# The user handbook: build the site, regenerate the command reference, restamp the translations,
# and check that all of it is current.
#
# Roadmap task T90.
# Design: docs/specs/2026-09-05-t90-the-documentation-site-design.md
#
#   bash packaging/docs.sh              build the site into target/site/
#   bash packaging/docs.sh --reference  regenerate docs/guide/en/cli.md from `mix` itself
#   bash packaging/docs.sh --restamp    rewrite every Vietnamese page's source_sha256
#   bash packaging/docs.sh --check      build into a temp dir, validate it, diff the reference
#
# **The site is not committed** and `--check` therefore diffs nothing but the reference — see the
# design's D8: `bindings/` is source code another repository compiles, and this is what a browser
# receives at a URL. What *is* committed is the Markdown corpus and the one generated page.
#
# `--restamp` is run **after** translating a page, never instead of it. All it records is that
# somebody looked; no machine here can check that a translation is right.
