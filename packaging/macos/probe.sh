# macOS: what an unsigned release looks like to Gatekeeper.
#
# Roadmap task T86a, design:
# docs/specs/2026-09-04-t86a-unsigned-distribution-design.md
#
# **This measures the mark, not the dialog.** Gatekeeper's first-open gate is reached through
# `com.apple.quarantine`, written by the application that downloaded the file. So what a machine can
# answer is which files in a MixEngine install ever carry one, and what the assessment says about the
# package itself. The Finder dialog and macOS 15's System Settings → Privacy & Security → "Open
# Anyway" path need a person — release checklist item 4 in
# docs/operations/build-and-release.md.
#
# Two rules this script is built on, both from the design:
#
#   * **Fail on our artifacts, record on the environment** (D3). A package that acquires a signature
#     nobody bought fails the job; a machine that cannot answer produces a *void reading*, printed
#     under its own heading, because a green job that measured nothing must not look like a green job
#     that measured and found nothing.
#   * **Never disarm the machine to get a reading** (D9). If assessments are off, M2 is void. There is
#     no `spctl --master-disable` anywhere here and there never will be: a reading taken on a machine
#     we disarmed is about our tampering and not about the product.

# none however it obtained the bytes. That is the empirical verification `updates.md` asks for on the
# update path — *"Updates downloaded by the already-running daemon are generally not quarantined.
# Verify this empirically before relying on it"* — and unlike the Windows half it can be tightened
# later against T88's real downloader.
