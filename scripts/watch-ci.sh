# Watch the CI run this branch asked for, and say what failed rather than that something did.
#
# CI fires by itself on a `v*` tag and on nothing else — see
# `docs/operations/build-and-release.md`. Every ref pushes and then requests a run, `master`
# included, and this is the loop that waits for the answer: it polls `gh run view`, prints each job as it settles,
# and on a failure prints an extract of the failing steps' logs so the next thing to read is the
# error and not a URL.
#
#   scripts/watch-ci.sh                 # the run for HEAD on the current branch
#   scripts/watch-ci.sh 32617405595     # a run by id
#   scripts/watch-ci.sh --once          # say where the run is now and exit; 2 means still running
#   INTERVAL=60 scripts/watch-ci.sh     # poll less often
#   EXTRACT_LINES=500 scripts/watch-ci.sh   # keep more of the failing log on screen
#   TIMEOUT=7200 scripts/watch-ci.sh    # wait longer than an hour before giving up
#
# **Every filter goes through `gh --jq` rather than a `jq` on the PATH.** `gh` embeds one; Git Bash
# on Windows ships no `jq` at all, and a watcher that only runs on two of the three machines this
# project targets is not one.
#
# **The run is picked by commit, never by recency.** `gh run list --limit 1` answers with whatever
# ran last on the branch, which between `gh workflow run` and the run appearing is the *previous*
# push — a watcher that exits 0 on the last green run instead of waiting for this one is worse than
# no watcher.
#
# **The reader is usually an agent, and it is charged for every line.** Three things follow from
# that. The full log goes to a file and only an extract is printed, because `--log-failed` on a
# three-OS matrix is tens of thousands of lines while the errors inside it are a few dozen. A
# failure that reads the same on two runners is printed once and named twice, because a matrix
# mostly fails the same way everywhere and the second copy buys nothing. And nothing is cut
# silently: a trimmed extract says by how much, since one that stops early without admitting it
# reads exactly like one that had nothing more to give.
#
# **A full run here takes longer than an agent's foreground command may.** Waiting fifteen minutes
# and then being killed at ten pays for the wait and learns nothing, so an agent should either run
# this in the background or poll it with `--once`, which asks, answers and exits.
#
# **A narrowed run says so on success.** `ask-ci.sh --jobs <group>` skips every job but one, and a
# green tick over three of nine is the single way this script could mislead the person reading it:
# the loop's rule is that green means *every* job settled green. The exit status stays CI's — the
# run did succeed — and what changes is that the line above it names what never ran.
#
# Exit status is CI's: 0 when the run succeeded, 1 when it did not, and — under `--once` only —
# 2 when it has not finished yet. A misuse of the script itself is 64, so that it cannot be read as
# a report about CI.
