# Lightweight resource isolation

**Goal**: the laptop stays cool and quiet. MixEngine's whole pitch against Docker is that idle
projects cost nothing — so idle *must* cost nothing.

Rationale for not using containers: [../decisions/0003-no-container-isolation.md](../decisions/0003-no-container-isolation.md).

## Three mechanisms

### 1. On-demand start (the big win)

Nothing but the daemon runs at login. Services start when something actually needs them:

- **Web traffic**: the front-end web server is the only always-on service (it is tiny — Caddy idles
  at a few MB). **Always-on means its `autostart` is on, and since T167e that is the default for a
  front end** ([ADR 0041](../decisions/0041-mixengine-stops-nothing-a-person-did-not-ask-it-to.md)):
  `service.create` turns it on for a recipe whose role is `FrontEnd` unless the request says
  otherwise, and migration `0027` turned it on once for every `caddy` / `nginx` row that existed.
  Before that nothing ticked it on anybody's behalf (T116, T129), and a restart left nothing listening
  on port 80 — which the fallback below cannot help with, because it lives inside the front end's own
  configuration. Every other service still defaults to off. The site file names *two* upstreams — the pool's own address first, and a second,
  permanent address the daemon holds — so a request to a stopped pool is refused by the first, and
  the front end retries it against the second. That one starts the pool, waits for its `ReadyCheck`,
  and proxies. First hit is slow (~1 s); the rest are normal, and go straight to the pool without
  touching `mixengined` at all.
- **Databases**: started when a site that declares them starts, or on the first connection. There is
  no front end in front of a database to name a fallback in, so here the daemon holds *the
  database's own* address while it is stopped, and gives it back on the start.
- **CLI**: `mix` commands that need a service start it explicitly.

**What holding a database's own address costs, stated plainly.** Between the moment the daemon lets
go of the address and the moment the server binds it — the server's own start time — nothing is
listening there, and a connection arriving inside that interval is refused by the operating system.
**The connection that woke the service is never the one refused**: it is already accepted, and it
waits on the service rather than on the address. Only a *second* client, dialling while the first
one's start is still running, meets the window, and its client will report a refused connection.

The alternative would be for the daemon to keep 3306 for itself for ever and forward every query
through — which would put every byte of every query through `mixengined` for the connection's whole
life, and would make a *running* database unreachable the moment the daemon died. Today a crashed
daemon leaves a working database, and that is not a property worth trading for a startup window.

### 2. Idle shutdown

A service may have an `IdlePolicy { after: Millis, probe: IdleProbe }`, and it is made of two halves
from two places: the **recipe** says how the service is measured, because only it knows which port
its pool listens on; the **row** says for how long, because that is the machine owner's to choose.
Idle is measured by real signals — established connections, and a counter read from a status endpoint
where the service publishes one — never by wall-clock alone. A service with an open connection is
never idle, nor is one something running depends on, nor is one that could not be measured at all.

`services.idle_minutes` has three states:

| Value | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `NULL` | nobody said: never idle-stopped, unless the home saves resources — then the recipe's number |
| `0` | never idle-stop, whatever the home or the recipe says |
| `n` | idle-stop after `n` minutes |

**MixEngine stops nothing a person did not ask it to stop** — T167b,
[ADR 0041](../decisions/0041-mixengine-stops-nothing-a-person-did-not-ask-it-to.md). Until T167 the
numbers below were every home's defaults, and a site that worked in the morning could be down by the
afternoon for a reason its owner never saw. Now every `Recipe::idle_default()` is `None`, and the
numbers are `Recipe::idle_when_saving()`: they reach a `NULL` row only while the home's switch — the
`settings` row `services.save_resources`, *Save battery* in MixLab, `mix service save-resources` —
is on. It is off unless a person turned it on.

**A recipe offers a number only once something can start its service again**, because a stopped
service with nothing to wake it is a site that answers 502 for ever. Each number therefore arrived
with the task that made its service wakeable. While *Save battery* is on:

| Recipe | After | Since |
| --- | --- | --- |
| php-fpm | 30 min | T70 — the request that finds the pool down is what wakes it |
| MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL | 60 min | T70a — the connection that finds the server down is what wakes it |
| Redis, Memcached | 60 min | T70a |
| Caddy, nginx | never | — the thing that starts everything else back up cannot be the thing that gets stopped |

A database waits longer than a pool on purpose: a pool starts in tens of milliseconds and a server
replays its log first, so an hour is the point at which stopping it is worth the wait to start it.

**Only a stop somebody asked for is one a request may not undo**, and that is the whole of the rule —
`services.stopped_by` says which of `never`, `person` and `daemon` left a service stopped, and the
first two of those are woken. A row that has never run is not a decision, and neither is a machine
that was restarted: both are the ordinary state of a laptop in the morning, and refusing them is the
opposite of the promise two paragraphs up. What stays refused is `mix service stop mariadb@main`,
where undoing it on the next request would be the tool overruling its user (T70's D8, T123).
Any of these is overridden per service — `mix service idle mariadb@main --after 0` never stops it.

**A database is measured by its connections and not by its query counter**, which the counter would
be the better signal for. Reading `Queries` means speaking the database's own protocol as an
authenticated user, and the probe lives on a `ServiceSpec`, which never carries a secret
([ADR 0006](../decisions/0006-servicespec-in-proto-and-secret-free.md)). The error is in the safe
direction: a client connected and idle reads as busy.

While *Save battery* is on, a project can opt out ("keep warm") for the one being worked on all
day — `mix project keep-warm <name>`. It reaches the PHP pool that project's sites name; it does not
yet reach the database they query, because nothing in the schema records which database a project
uses. With the switch off it changes nothing, which is why MixLab no longer shows it on the project
form (T167g); the column, the API field and the verb stay.

**The sweep looks through the last rendering (T190b).** Every thirty seconds it asks which running
services have a policy and what depends on them. It answers from the graph the last change produced,
up to ten minutes old, and renders again only before it stops something, which it then decides on
the fresh graph. So it no longer rewrites this home's configuration every thirty seconds: that was
half of what the daemon spent at rest on Windows. A generated file edited by hand is put back at the
next change or within ten minutes, and `mix doctor` reports it in the meantime
([design](../specs/2026-09-28-t190b-the-idle-sweep-does-not-render-to-look-design.md)).

**A service MixEngine stopped is drawn as resting, not as stopped.** `ServiceSummary.stopped_by`
(T167d) and the transition's reason let a client tell the three apart: `daemon` — resting, woken by
the next request, grey; `person` — stopped, stays stopped; a crash — `failed`, red.

**When a wake does not finish, a PHP site says so.** The 502 or 504 the front end produces for a pool
it cannot reach is answered with `welcome/<domain>.starting.html` (T167f): the page reloads itself
three times, two seconds apart, and then says to open MixLab. An application's own 502 passes through
untouched.

### 3. Hard limits

`ResourceLimits { cpu_percent: Option<u8>, memory_mb: Option<u32>, priority: Priority }` applied per
service via the platform layer:

| OS | CPU | Memory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | Job Object `CpuRateControlInformation` (hard cap, % of one core × N) | Job Object `ProcessMemoryLimit` / `JobMemoryLimit` |
| Linux | cgroup v2 `cpu.max` in a per-service scope under the user slice | `memory.max` + `memory.high` |
| macOS | `setpriority`/`taskpolicy` background QoS only — **no hard cap available** | watchdog (T71a): warn, then restart where the recipe permits |

macOS honesty rule: no client may offer a memory-limit control that does nothing there, which means
the API reports what the platform actually supports rather than a uniform shape. Since T71a the
memory control *does* do something there, and says so as `Enforcement::Advisory` — watched, not
capped — which is a fourth answer rather than a promotion of the old one.


### The watchdog, where nothing caps memory

**Built at T71a.** A `memory_mb` on macOS — and on a Linux session that was never delegated the
`memory` controller — used to be a number the daemon stored and nothing read. It is now compared,
every minute, against the readings the metrics sampler already takes:

- **Where it arms**: wherever `LimitSupport::memory` is not `Hard`. The daemon asks the machine, never
  the operating system's name, so a Linux home without cgroup delegation gets the same protection
  macOS does.
- **What is judged**: the finished minute's `rss_avg` against the declared ceiling. Not the peak — a
  service twice its usual size for five seconds is a service doing its work. `MemoryMeasure::Resident`
  is what says on the wire that RSS is the quantity here, and that it overstates shared pages.
- **What follows**: over the line, the service goes `Degraded` with `StateReason::OverMemory`. Over it
  for **three consecutive finished minutes**, the service is restarted — *if its recipe permits*.
  php-fpm pools do; databases and caches do not, because a restart mid-transaction is a data question
  and restarting a cache deletes what somebody believes is still there. The person's control is
  `memory_mb` itself: nothing watches a service that declared no ceiling.
- **One restart per episode.** After a restart the service must be seen *under* the line once before
  it may be restarted again. A pool that leaks up to its ceiling every twenty minutes is rescued
  every twenty minutes; a ceiling set below what the service needs at boot costs exactly one restart
  and then a service left alone in `Degraded`, because that is a misconfiguration rather than a leak.
- **A missing minute means nobody measured**, and resets the count. A laptop that slept eight hours
  wakes with no evidence, not with eight hours of it.

**One honest wrinkle.** With nobody watching, a finished minute holds a single reading, so the
average is that reading; with a client holding `GET /metrics` open it holds sixty, and the average
genuinely smooths. The watchdog is therefore slightly more sensitive to a spike when nobody is
looking. What protects against a transient is the three consecutive minutes, and that rule is the
same at either rate.

`service.limits` reports it per service — `watchdog: { after_minutes, restarts }`, and `null` where
nothing is watching — because whether *this* service would be restarted is its recipe's answer, and
`LimitSupport` describes a machine.

### Defaults tuned for a laptop, which save more RAM than any cgroup will

**Settled at T73**, and measured rather than claimed — the paragraph that used to stand here promised
tuning the database templates had not had.

What the generated configuration now says, and none of it is a knob a recipe offers: every line is
stated in the template with the reason beside it, and `extra` renders last for anybody who wants
otherwise.

| Server | Tuned to | The server's own | Why it is memory a laptop pays for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MariaDB, MySQL | `innodb_buffer_pool_size 64M` | `128M` | allocated at startup, held with nobody connected |
| MariaDB, MySQL | `key_buffer_size 16M` | `128M` | MyISAM's key cache, and a modern application has no MyISAM tables |
| MySQL | `performance_schema OFF` | `ON` | preallocated instrumentation tables nothing here reads; MariaDB already ships it off |
| PostgreSQL | `shared_buffers 32MB` | `128MB` | one shared segment taken at startup |

And one thing that is not memory: **the log is flushed once a second rather than at every commit** —
`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2`, `synchronous_commit = off`. A power cut costs the last second
of committed transactions and **cannot corrupt anything**: `fsync`, `full_page_writes` and
`innodb_doublewrite` are deliberately untouched, and each recipe has a test asserting they stay that
way. What it buys is the migration and the seed — thousands of tiny transactions that otherwise each
wait for a disk.

**Two knobs were examined and deliberately left alone.** `max_connections` allocates per *actual*
connection, so lowering it saves nothing on an idle machine and turns a busy afternoon into an error
that arrives from MixEngine. And php-fpm's `pm.max_children` is already worth nothing at idle,
because an idle pool is stopped outright — shrinking it would only slow down the machine while
somebody is using it.

**The saving is measured, and gated.** `crates/mixengine-cli/tests/tuned_footprint.rs` runs two
MariaDB instances in one home — one on these defaults, one put back to the server's own — and holds
the *difference* between them to a floor in the `bench` job. Measured on MariaDB 10.11: **77.2 MB
against 98.7 MB, a saving of 21.6 MB — 21.8 % of what the server's own values held**, for one
database on one machine doing nothing.

The gate is a **fraction** (five per cent) rather than a number of megabytes, and both halves of that
are deliberate. A budget on MariaDB's own RSS would be a promise held hostage to next month's
MariaDB, a number this project does not control — the same reasoning that has the idle footprint
gate `mixengined` and merely report the total. And a floor at a quarter of what was measured leaves
room for another series and another operating system to allocate differently, while still being ten
times the 0.4 % that two *identical* servers were measured apart.

PHP's ini set was tuned at T28 and is unchanged here: `memory_limit = 512M`, `upload_max_filesize =
128M`, `display_errors = On`, and an opcache that revalidates every request.

## Measuring, not guessing

The daemon samples per-process CPU/RSS for each supervised process group — and for `mixengined`
itself, which is half of the footprint below — and keeps a 24-hour history of one row per subject per
minute, so a client can answer "what is eating my battery" and "how much does MixEngine cost when I'm
not using it".

**Two rates, settled at T71.** A reading a second while a client holds `GET /metrics` open, and a
reading a minute when nobody is watching. The second rate is what makes the history worth keeping:
the night nobody was watching is exactly the night the battery question is about. One reading
refreshed every process on the machine until T181: about 10 ms on Windows, about 2 ms on Linux and
12–15 ms on a busy Mac, measured, where `sysinfo` reads every process's arguments on each refresh.
Since T181 a reading lists each process's parent the cheap way and refreshes only the processes in a
group — about 0.5 ms on the same Mac, a two-thousandth of a core at the fast rate
([design](../specs/2026-09-24-t181-a-reading-refreshes-only-the-groups-it-measures-design.md)).
Windows had not gained: `sysinfo` lists every process there even when asked for a few, so a
reading still cost 14.6 ms and the daemon held 5–6% of a core while the tray panel was open. Since
T190 the listing is kept between readings and each member is read by pid on Windows: 41 µs a
reading, and the daemon at 0.8–1.4% of a core with a stream open, of which 0.6–0.7% it spends with
nobody watching
([design](../specs/2026-09-28-t190-a-reading-on-windows-does-not-list-the-machine-design.md)).

**Stored per core, shown per machine (T190c).** `cpu_percent`, `cpu_avg` and `cpu_peak` stay a
percentage of one core, the unit a limit is declared in. Every frame and history carries `cores`,
the machine's logical processors, and MixLab and `mix` divide by it to show a share of the whole
machine with one decimal, as Task Manager does. The figure on the stream is the mean of the last
five seconds of readings, because one second of CPU time on Windows is a count of 15.6 ms quanta.
The minute history is kept from the readings themselves
([design](../specs/2026-09-29-t190c-cpu-is-shown-the-way-task-manager-shows-it-design.md)).

**The reading is `mixengine-platform`'s `ProcessMetrics`, not `sysinfo` in the daemon** — the same
place every other question about this machine is asked, with a programmable mock beside it, which is
what lets the minute arithmetic and the retention be tested from invented numbers. A group is walked
from its root pid, and a root is identified by pid **and** the moment that process began: a pid the
system handed round would otherwise draw a stranger's memory on a service's chart.

**What `rss_bytes` overstates, said rather than hidden.** Shared pages are counted once per process,
so a php-fpm master and its four workers add up to more than they occupy. There is no cross-platform
way to do better, the error is identical on all three systems, and it is in the safe direction for a
number defended in a README. It is also **not** the quantity a `memory_mb` limit is judged against —
that is commit charge on Windows and charged pages on Linux, per `MemoryMeasure`.

**A minute with no row means nobody measured** — the service was stopped, or the machine was asleep.
It never means nothing was used, and `cpu_percent` is null rather than zero where no figure could be
taken.

Two numbers we publish and defend in the README:

- **Idle footprint** (daemon + Caddy, nothing else running): target **< 60 MB RSS**, ~0 % CPU.
  **Measured by the `bench` job on all three systems since T72, and reported rather than enforced** —
  57 MB on Windows, 67 MB on Linux, 69 MB on macOS, as the median of five readings taken thirty
  seconds after the last command through the daemon's own `metrics.snapshot`.
  **What is enforced is `mixengined` alone, under 42 MB** — measured at 21 MB on Windows, 25 MB on
  Linux and 30 MB on macOS when the budget was set at 36 MB on 2026-08-30, and at 31, 30 and 35 MB a
  week later, which is what raised it (T72b in the roadmap owes the reason for the growth) — because
  the split is roughly a third daemon to two thirds Caddy: most of the published number belongs to a
  Go program this project neither wrote nor tunes, and a gate on the total would go red for a reason
  no commit here could fix. The daemon is the half that regresses when this code grows, and it is
  the half a budget can defend.
- **Cold path**: first request to a stopped site served in **< 1.5 s**. **Measured and enforced by
  the `bench` job on all three systems since T72a**, three rounds per run against three PHP versions
  — measured in release at **108 ms on Linux, 129 ms on macOS and 574 ms on Windows**, as the median
  of three rounds. Windows is five times the others because a pool there is `php-cgi.exe` and process
  creation is what a cold path mostly is; it is still well inside the budget.
  **What had been missing was not the activator** — T70 gives a pool on a socket one, derived beside
  the pool's own path, and both site templates have rendered it as the second upstream since then.
  It was the *probe*: `IdleProbe` could only count connections to a port, a pool on a socket has
  none, and a service with no probe is never idle-stopped however its row is set. So there was no
  stopped site for a first request to arrive at. T72a asks php-fpm about itself over FastCGI
  instead — `pm.status_path`, on the pool's own socket, on every PHP from 7.0 upwards.

  **A pool is idle when no worker is serving**, and deliberately not when a connection counter has
  stopped moving: the daemon's own health check is a connection every ten seconds, so that counter is
  mostly the daemon's own footprints. What that costs is that a site used in short bursts can be
  stopped between two readings and pay one cold path; what it never costs is a request in flight.

**What the CI reading is, and is not.** The daemon it measures has just installed a package, rendered
configuration and walked a start plan, so its RSS carries the high-water mark of all of it — a real
machine idle for an afternoon holds less. The number is therefore *worse* than the promise is about,
which is why it is usable: passing at 60 MB there means passing comfortably here. Restarting the
daemon and re-adopting the web server would be closer and cannot be done on two of three systems —
[ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md): a daemon leaving takes its
whole job down on Windows and its immediate children on Linux.

## What we deliberately do not do

- No filesystem or network namespaces: projects share the user's filesystem, which is the point —
  editing files is instant and every tool works normally.
- No per-project database isolation by default: one shared MariaDB with per-project databases. A
  blueprint can request a dedicated instance when a project genuinely needs a different version.
- No attempt to hide processes from Activity Monitor / Task Manager. Every process we start is named
  clearly (`mixengine: php-fpm 8.3`) so users can see exactly what we run.

## Acceptance criteria

- After 30 minutes of inactivity, `ps`/Task Manager shows only `mixengined` and the web server.
- A request to an idle site succeeds (no error page, no manual start) within the cold-path budget —
  `cold_path.rs` in the `bench` job, on all three systems, since **T72a**.
- Setting a memory limit on Windows/Linux is observably enforced by an integration test that allocates
  past it.
- The CI benchmark fails the build if the idle footprint regresses beyond the budget — `bench`, on
  all three systems, since **T72**; and if the cold path does, since **T72a**.
