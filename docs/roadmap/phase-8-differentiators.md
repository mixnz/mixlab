---

- [x] **T74** LAN sharing: per-site opt-in **and its manual reverse**, a second listener on the
      shared site's block and nothing else rebound, firewall rule (one elevation prompt), the LAN
      URL, and the site certificate reissued with the LAN IP among its SANs so HTTPS does not break
      the moment it leaves loopback. Where the firewall cannot be managed, say so and give the
      manual command rather than reporting success. A QR code is a rendering of that URL and not a
      screen this repo owns: the daemon answers the URL, `mix` prints the code in the terminal, a
      graphical client draws its own. **(P)**
- [x] **T75** mDNS advertisement (`<slug>-mixengine.local` — **one label**, because a multi-label
      name under `.local` does not resolve; measured, see the T75 design's D1, which is where this
      line's own earlier spelling was overturned), that name added to the certificate SANs beside
      the LAN IP, and the CA download endpoint for phones — served only while sharing is on, only
      the public certificate, out of a directory that holds nothing else. Also fixes a defect T74
      shipped: `mix cert status` reported `NamesDiffer` for every shared site, because the
      comparison read the bare domain list while the certificate carried the LAN address. **(P)**
- [x] **T76** Revoking *by itself*, the manual path having landed with T74: a network change
      disables sharing and says why, taking the same road `site.unshare` takes — and **a finding has
      to survive two consecutive checks**, because one enumeration during a DHCP renewal or a wake
      from sleep would otherwise unshare every site on the machine (the design's D2, which is the
      correction the task turned on). Optional `--for 2h` expiry, measured against the `shared_since`
      T74 stores, and a length shorter than the share has already lasted is *refused* rather than
      honoured: a URL that is dead when it is printed is worse than a sentence saying so. Sharing
      reported on the event stream as one `SiteSharingChanged` carrying why. Two enforcement tests:
      the "web ports only" scan — which proves what is *listening* and says so, since it never
      crosses a firewall — and no firewall rule left behind, enumerated by label, a Windows test
      because `ufw` has no comment field to name a rule of ours with. **And the rule MixEngine never
      made**, answered: the responder now binds UDP 5353 only while something is shared, so Windows'
      dialog arrives in the second after somebody typed `mix site share` rather than at every daemon
      start; MixEngine refuses to pre-empt it with a rule of its own, which would cost T75's D8 and a
      prompt at start; and `mix doctor` reports the rule as a **note** with the command to remove it,
      never as a `Problem` — a `ProblemId` is what `doctor_repair` matches on, and deleting a rule
      somebody personally clicked Allow on is not a repair. **(P)**
- [x] **T180** A firewall prompt with nothing behind it. `sites::sharing::wants_the_firewall` queues
      the whole state on every sharing change and compares it with nothing, so sharing and then
      unsharing before a grant leaves *allow no ports* waiting on a machine that was never opened,
      and sharing a second site queues the ports the first one already had applied. The other four
      producers read the machine and stopped asking when it agreed (**T179**); this one cannot,
      because T74 decided the daemon never reads a rule set back and the only platform read counts
      rules naming a *program*. So the home remembers the plan it last had applied and compares with
      that instead. Named by T179's design, which left it alone deliberately: it is a prompt that
      does nothing rather than a sentence that says the wrong thing.
      **One settings row is the whole of it.** A grant that carries a firewall plan records it under
      `firewall.applied`, and the producer compares the plan it builds with that record: equal
      withdraws the queued row through T179's `no_longer_needed`, different enqueues as before.
      Nothing reads the machine's rules, which is still T74's decision.
      Design: [2026-09-23-t180-a-firewall-prompt-with-work-behind-it-design.md](../specs/2026-09-23-t180-a-firewall-prompt-with-work-behind-it-design.md).

- [x] **T77** Blueprint manifest, `blueprint.capture` and the plan `mix blueprint apply --dry-run`
      prints. The manifest is **its own type** overlapping `mixengine.toml` rather than sharing its
      struct, with one hand-built writer so that capturing a project twice gives two byte-identical
      files. Capture reads `sites` → `site_service_links`, tokenises the project's own name to
      `{project}` **by substitution and never by invention** — a domain that does not carry the name
      keeps its literal spelling and the plan reports the conflict — and reads an instance named
      after the project as `per-project`, which is what stops a second project plugging into the
      first one's database. A project with two sites is refused by name. The promise "never data,
      credentials or absolute paths" became a test that reads the **rendered TOML** and refuses to
      find them. The plan reads this home's tables and **never the index**, decides every blocker
      itself — a taken domain, a directory that is already a project, a name too long for a database
      account — and marks the steps that will ask for elevation, said once at the end.
      **Two pieces of text this task found wrong**: `[php] ini`, which the feature doc promised and
      nothing on any machine deviates from, so it is gone rather than filled with a global default;
      and `kept_warm`'s note claiming its missing join waited on T77, when `site_service_links` has
      held that edge since `0006`. And one defect older than the task: `mix project update --name`
      panicked in a debug build, two clap arguments sharing an id — now caught by a test that builds
      every command this binary offers.
- [x] **T77a** Creating a database and the account that reaches it, which `PlanAction::CreateDatabase`
      named and nothing in this workspace could do: a `Recipe` hook the three database packages
      implement, and a daemon runner on T33's division — the recipe says what statements, the daemon
      says with which credential. **A keyring entry is the deed of ownership**: an account MixEngine
      holds no credential for is refused rather than seized by an `ALTER USER`, which costs one
      read-only probe and is the whole difference between "ensure" and "take over". The rule came out
      as a pure function of what the probe found and what the store holds, so the thing the task rests
      on is a four-row table test with no server and no keyring in it. On PostgreSQL the account
      *owns* the database, because `GRANT ALL ON DATABASE` has not carried `CREATE` on `public` since
      15 — a Django blueprint would otherwise apply cleanly and die on its first migration — so the
      role is created before the database, and that difference is why the step order belongs to the
      recipe rather than to a sequence shared with the MySQL family, which took the other order and
      one shared statement builder. No table and no migration: the server is the record, the keyring
      is the deed, and the address joining them is `<service-id>/<user>`, which
      `Context::secret_address` already composed.
      **The last step logs in as the account just made** and creates a table with it — a real one in
      `public`, since a temporary table lives in a schema of its own and would prove nothing about the
      ownership above. It is a postcondition rather than an assertion in a suite because
      `tests/mariadb.rs` had already found out what the alternative costs: on macOS a keychain item
      carries an ACL naming the application that created it, so a *test process* reading the daemon's
      credential raises a dialog nobody can answer, measured once at twenty-seven minutes before the
      job timed out. Moving the proof inside the method left the three real-server suites with nothing
      to read.
      `create` only, and that is what keeps a drop out of T78: a rollback leaves a database it made
      and says it left it, because by then a scaffold may have migrated into it.
      **Two things found on the way.** `Step` and its runner moved out of `first_run` into
      `generate::step` and `services::step`, because a bootstrap and a provisioning are two kinds of
      work with one shape and the module they lived in is named after only one of them. And T77 left
      four blueprint error variants falling into `ToWire`'s `_ => internal` arm, so a mistyped
      blueprint name reached a client as an internal error; they are classified now, beside the three
      this task added.
- [x] **T78** `blueprint.apply` execution with resumable idempotent actions and rollback scoped to
      what this apply created; a version mismatch is answered as a choice (install / use the
      installed one / cancel), never decided quietly. **Resuming is running it again** and there is
      no ledger: every action is an *ensure*, so a second apply plans against what the first one
      left and reports `already true` down the list — which cost three honesty fixes in T77's plan,
      each one narrower than the block it replaced, and the third of them (a project that already
      holds its site) was found by the test rather than by reading. Rollback undoes what belongs to
      the *project* and keeps what belongs to the machine — the database, an installed
      runtime or package, an extension it turned on, the directory — naming each; the ledger records
      **intent** rather than success, because `sites::create` deliberately keeps the row it wrote
      when the rendering fails. `job.cancel` stops and does **not** roll back: running it again
      continues, and a cancellation is not a request to delete anything.
      **Two things T77's plan could not do, found by trying to execute it.** `RegisterProject`
      carried no `pins`, so an applied project ran whatever PHP the machine defaults to and a capture
      of it came back with no `[runtimes]` at all — the pin is also what makes the version question
      mean something, since without it both answers leave identical machines. And there was no
      `InstallPackage`: a blueprint from somebody else's machine planned `EnsureService` on a MariaDB
      that is not on disk, and `service.create` refuses — which is a plan discovering the impossible
      five actions into a project directory, the one thing a plan exists to prevent.
      An apply **queues** elevation and never raises a prompt, on T40b's standing rule; the client
      spends the single prompt at the end. A certificate or an extension that fails is reported as a
      step that did not run rather than undoing a working project, `site.create`'s own position. The
      job's bar is sliced per step, so a nested install reporting 0–100 of itself no longer drags it
      backwards.
      Scaffold execution stays T78a's: everything else is applied and the exact command is printed
      for somebody to run.
- [x] **T78a** Scaffold trust: `[scaffold]` is arbitrary code from whoever wrote the blueprint.
      It never runs on import, only on apply, only after a confirmation showing the exact command,
      with output streamed to the job log; gallery blueprints are signed and a hand-imported one is
      marked untrusted for good. **Trust is a column decided when a blueprint arrives** — the
      signature is checked once, over the bytes handed in, and nothing raises the flag afterwards;
      that is the departure from `index.rs`, which keeps the signed bytes and re-verifies them,
      and it is forced by the row being the truth while the file beside it is a rendering.
      **The consent names the command** rather than saying yes, and carries whether the person was
      told the blueprint was unsigned: a blueprint re-imported between the plan and the apply is
      the case both halves exist for. `blueprint.import` arrived with this task, since without it
      nothing could produce an untrusted blueprint at all.
      **Three things found on the way.** T77's plan never expanded `{project}` into the scaffold
      command, so a blueprint naming the project in its own command planned the token — fixed where
      every other expansion happens, because what is shown has to be what runs. A step that *ran and
      failed* needed a fourth `StepResult`: making it the job's failure would have thrown away the
      report of the nine steps that worked. And the log surface grew a second kind of subject —
      `GET /logs/service/{id}` and `GET /logs/job/{id}`, plus `mix job logs` — because a command's
      output is exactly the volume ADR 0009 keeps off the event stream.
      **`--run-scaffold` and `--run-untrusted-scaffold` are different flags**, neither implied by
      the other; where there is nobody to ask, the command is left unrun with a line saying so
      rather than the apply being refused, because there is no flag for *no* and a script must be
      able to apply a blueprint without its command.
- [x] **T78b** A `[scaffold]`'s program is checked at plan time — design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-08-t78b-a-scaffold-program-checked-at-plan-time-design.md](../specs/2026-09-08-t78b-a-scaffold-program-checked-at-plan-time-design.md).
      Found by applying `laravel` on a Windows machine without `composer`: eleven steps applied and
      the twelfth was `cmd.exe` saying it did not recognise the word, which is the one step T77's
      D10 had left to the end of the job. The first word of the command, when it is a bare name, is
      now looked for on the PATH the command would run with — `platform::process::program_on_path`,
      by `cmd.exe`'s `PATHEXT` rule and `execvp`'s execute bit — and a miss is a `blocked` step
      naming the program and both halves of that PATH. **It blocks the command and not the apply**,
      because T78a made the scaffold the one optional step: a consent for a blocked command is
      refused up front, no consent leaves it unrun with the reason. **Every doubt resolves to not
      judging** — quotes, shell syntax, paths, `VAR=x`, and a short list of builtins (`echo` is what
      the scaffold suite runs on Windows) leave the step `confirm`. The gallery is unchanged;
      `laravel` and `symfony` now say `blocked` where they said `confirm` on a machine without
      `composer`, which T25 keeps out of the shims on purpose — whether to ship it is the next task.
- [x] **T78c** A `[scaffold]` that initialises a project says so, and the plan checks the directory.
      T78b's own shape one question along, and found the same way: applying `laravel` into a folder
      that already held something applied eleven steps and then handed over composer's *"Project
      directory is not empty"* — D10's subject exactly, a step the plan could have refused before
      anything was made. The manifest gained `[scaffold] needs_empty_dir`, **declared and never
      inferred**: `composer create-project .` refuses a directory holding anything at all while
      `composer install` on a cloned tree needs one, and nothing about the two strings separates
      them. Default `false`, so every manifest written before the key runs where it used to.
      **The PATH is still judged first** — a machine with no `composer` is not made applicable by
      emptying a folder, and only one reason is ever shown. The refusal names the entries in the
      way rather than saying *not empty*, because the entry this is hit on is very often `.git` or
      what an apply that stopped partway left behind, and a file manager hiding dotfiles shows an
      empty folder to somebody reading that it is not.
      **Nothing in the clients changed and nothing in the wire did**: the desktop's Apply button
      already refuses a plan with a blocked step, the CLI already prints the reason, and T78b's D5
      still holds — a blocked scaffold blocks the scaffold and not the apply, so `mix` can still
      apply the other eleven steps and leave the command unrun.
      **What it deliberately does not do** is empty the directory. A resumed apply whose first run
      left files behind is now told why rather than failing late, and clearing them stays the
      person's — `project.delete`'s standing rule that the files were never ours is the same rule.
- [x] **T78d** A `[scaffold]`'s program counts the runtimes the plan installs. T185b made `bin/`
      front only what is installed, which T78b's check never heard about: on a fresh machine there
      is no `bin/composer` when the plan is made, so every Composer entry in the gallery planned
      `blocked` on exactly the machine it was meant for — and on one with Composer installed and no
      PHP too, since the `composer` shim needs both. A first word that is one of the shim table's
      commands is now `confirm` when its kind, and the kind it runs through, are in the blueprint's
      `[runtimes]` or already installed; the runtime steps put it in `bin/` before the scaffold runs.
      A miss names what is missing — *`composer` runs on php* — rather than the PATH. The gallery
      suite had handed every plan a `composer` and an `npx`, which is how it hid; it now plans on an
      empty PATH and checks that each command is a shim its own `[runtimes]` provides.
- [x] **T79** Built-in blueprint gallery — six blueprints compiled into the binary and seeded as
      `builtin` rows at daemon start, which is the first thing in this product to write that word.
      **Trusted without a signature check**, and that is the departure from what T78a expected of
      this task: a signature carried inside the same binary as the key that checks it proves nothing
      the binary has not proved already, so the signing half moved to T79a rather than being
      performed for the look of it. Seeding **compares before it writes**, on `bin/`'s rule — every
      CLI test in this workspace starts a daemon, and six file writes on each of those buy nothing.
      **Three of the six carry a command.** The other three ship none rather than one that half
      works: no cross-platform, non-interactive command exists for WordPress, and Django's would
      install into a Python every other project shares. A gallery command may not be interactive
      either, because T78a gave a scaffold no timeout on purpose.
      **The cross-OS criterion is capture's, not the gallery's** — a hand-written manifest is
      byte-identical on all three systems, so applying one says nothing about what a Windows machine
      writes. What proves it is a real capture taken on Windows, committed as a fixture, and applied
      by every system in the ordinary suite.
      Found on the way: the six files must be written in the renderer's own canonical form, since a
      hand-written one with comments would make the file here, the `manifest_toml` column and the
      file in a user's home three different texts for one blueprint.
- [x] **T79a** The gallery published as signed files — `<slug>.toml` and a `.minisig` beside it,
      under a moved `blueprints` tag in the packaging repository, signed with the key T78a minted.
      T78a's design placed this in T79; T79 compiled the gallery in instead, which removed the
      channel these signatures are for and left this as the task that restores it. Design:
      [docs/specs/2026-09-02-t79a-signed-gallery-publication-design.md](../specs/2026-09-02-t79a-signed-gallery-publication-design.md).
      **The manifests are never copied into that repository** — its workflow checks this one out at
      a ref and reads them there, so there is one gallery and not two.
      **What the task found, and the one behaviour change here.** `[blueprint] name` is *display*
      text: the six say `Laravel`, `Next.js`, `Static site`. Import with no `--name` filed a
      blueprint under exactly that string, so `validated_slug` refused every gallery file before the
      signature was ever reached — the headline of this task was broken for all six. A file is now
      filed under **its own stem**, which is also the only fallback that round-trips this product's
      own output, since everything it renders is written as `<slug>.toml`. T78a's test never saw it:
      its fixture is `borrowed.toml` named `borrowed`.
      **The step the index's publish does not need** is what the whole chain rests on: the run reads
      `blueprints::trust::PUBLIC_KEY` out of the checkout and fails before signing when it disagrees
      with the committed `blueprints.pub`. Verifying against the public half alone only proves the
      secret matched it; what decides whether a signature is worth anything is the constant the
      application compiles in. A half-finished key rotation is a red run instead of a published tag
      nobody can use.
      **Two things the moved tag forced.** `--clobber` deletes nothing, so a slug the gallery drops
      would keep a valid signature at a stable URL for good — and trust is decided when a blueprint
      arrives and never re-examined, so the orphan is pruned after every upload. And *created* is not
      *published*: the run downloads what it just uploaded and verifies that. `check-blueprints.yml`
      says weekly whether the published set is still master's.
      **What the six are for now that every home has them**: a blueprint an installed build does not
      carry, a correction between releases, and a file to read and fork. Replacing one of the six
      needs `--overwrite` and costs that slug its builtin refresh, which is T79's D6 doing what it
      was written to do.
- [x] **T79b** Say *why* a blueprint is untrusted — design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-02-t79b-why-a-blueprint-is-untrusted-design.md](../specs/2026-09-02-t79b-why-a-blueprint-is-untrusted-design.md).
      A file whose signature did not verify and a file that arrived with no signature at all used to
      produce one line — `untrusted: nothing vouches for it, and nothing will` — and they are not
      the same event: the first is a manifest edited after somebody signed it, which is what the
      gallery key exists to catch. `SignatureCheck` (`verified` / `missing` / `rejected`) now rides
      beside `trusted` on `BlueprintSummary` and `BlueprintPlan`, out of a `signature` column added
      by `0015`, and `mix` says it at import, in the `TRUST` column (`signed` / `unsigned` /
      `mismatched`) and in the question asked before a `[scaffold]` command runs. **Trust is still
      decided once**: this is a reason beside the answer, never a re-check.
      **The reason had to be a column, not a field on a response** — `blueprint.list` reads rows,
      so a test asserting only what `import` answered would stay green with the migration broken;
      the daemon test reads the listing back for that reason. **`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` is where a
      stale reason would have come from**, and its test fails when that one line is removed:
      without it, re-importing an unsigned file over a verified row leaves `trusted = 0` beside
      `signature = 'verified'`. The migration backfills only the knowable half — an `imported` row
      that is trusted can only have come from a signature that verified; an untrusted one is either
      of the other two, and stays NULL rather than guessed. **A fourth variant for "signed by
      another key" was refused**: the only thing that could tell it from "signed by the gallery and
      then edited" is the key id inside the `.minisig`, which is not authenticated — whoever edits
      the file edits the key id with it, so the sentence says "it is not the gallery's", which is
      true of all three failures the verifier folds together. Pinning the reason into
      `ScaffoldConsent` was considered and declined, with the reason and the case that would reopen
      it written into the design's D9.

- [x] **T80** Extension model: `extension.toml` read through the `ServiceSpec` vocabulary in
      `mixengine-proto`, the four kinds, and permission enforcement — design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-02-t80-extension-model-design.md](../specs/2026-09-02-t80-extension-model-design.md).
      Nothing is installed and nothing is stored: what this leaves T81 is a format already proved to
      make sense, and one read-only way to see it — `extension.inspect`, and `mix extension inspect`,
      which renders the manifest into the `ServiceSpec` that *would* run rather than describing one.
      That is `apply --dry-run`'s position: a plan is worth having because it was computed.
      **`network = "loopback"` is enforced, and by having nothing to enforce**: a manifest may not
      write an address at all. `{listen}` renders from `permissions.network` and from nothing else,
      and a host spelled out anywhere in the file — `127.0.0.1` included, which is the one an author
      would write in good faith — is refused at parse. The alternative was a column consulted
      wherever exposure could happen, which is a rule to remember at every future site that could
      expose something, and T76 is the task that measured what one forgotten check of that shape
      costs. `filesystem = ["own-data"]` is enforced the same way: it *is* the placeholder
      vocabulary, because every path must grow from `{install_dir}` or `{data_dir}` and a manifest
      naming an absolute path is refused before anything reads it.
      **The scoped token this line used to promise was refused** — [ADR
      0014](../decisions/0014-an-extension-is-not-an-api-client.md). An extension runs as the user's
      own account, and the access control on the endpoint *is* the account, so a token it held is
      one it could put down and open its own connection instead; making it a boundary means a token
      on every connection, `mix` included, which is the second access-control story T8 already
      refused for a case nobody has. No extension in the plan calls the daemon API. `[permissions]
      services` stays as a **declaration shown before an extension is installed**, `[scaffold]`
      consent's shape, and every surface that prints it says so.
      **Three documents this task found wrong.** `features/extensions.md` and
      `architecture/process-supervision.md` (twice) said a `ServiceSpec` deserialises out of an
      `extension.toml`; it cannot — sixteen fields against four, no `ServiceId`, and every path and
      address a template — so the manifest is its own type over the shared *vocabulary* and the spec
      is built through the builder, which is T77's finding arriving a second time.
      `security-model.md`'s bullet was a promise and is now the decision, which is that document's
      own opening sentence applied to one of its own lines.
      **`[recipe]` accompanies any kind**, because T82 asks for Mailpit *with* a `sendmail_path`
      recipe and two extensions for one product would be two things to install and uninstall in step;
      `kind = "recipe"` means an extension that is only that. And **an extension id a compiled-in
      recipe already claims is refused** here rather than discovered when T81 writes the row.
      Two smaller things found by running it: a rendered path used to mix separators on Windows
      (`…\mailpit/mailpit`), so the path that begins at a placeholder is now spelled the way this
      system spells one, up to the next whitespace — an *argument* is left exactly as it will be
      passed; and `mixengine-daemon/src/extensions.rs` was already taken by PHP extensions, so it is
      `php_extensions.rs`, which is what it was always about.
      **What T81 is handed**: a `services` row has `Origin::Package` or `Origin::RuntimeInstall`
      with a `CHECK` that exactly one is set, and an installed `service` extension is neither — the
      third origin arrives with the task that writes rows, not with this one.
- [x] **T81** Extension registry client + install/uninstall/start/stop — design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-02-t81-extension-registry-and-lifecycle-design.md](../specs/2026-09-02-t81-extension-registry-and-lifecycle-design.md).
      `extensions.json` is a second signed document beside `index.json`, under the same tag and the
      **same key**: an extension has the package index's blast radius exactly — a binary downloaded
      and supervised — so a key of its own would separate nothing. Two documents rather than one
      array, for failure isolation: an entry a newer build published has to be skippable, and
      skipping it inside the document that also lists every runtime means `mix runtime list` can die
      of an extension. `index::Client` is generic over its document rather than copied, because two
      copies of a verify-then-parse path is one copy that eventually skips a step.
      **An entry *is* a manifest**, which is what lets the permissions question be asked before a
      byte of artifact is fetched — asking afterwards is asking after doing the thing somebody was
      about to refuse. The `Error::Index*` family stays one family and gains `document`: a test
      caught a registry served by the wrong key being refused with *"the package index … is not
      signed"*, which sends the reader somewhere they can do nothing about.
      **Four things the task found.** `0001` had reserved an `extensions` table whose every column
      was wrong for what T80 turned out to need, and nothing had ever written to it — dropped on
      0006's reasoning rather than migrated. `{data_dir}` had to move out of `{install_dir}`,
      because *"an uninstall keeps your captured mail"* is not a promise a nested layout can keep.
      A port kept anywhere SQL cannot reach is a port handed out twice — so `extension_ports` is a
      table, and both allocators now ask one query. And the allocation lock is not reentrant:
      holding it across `services::create` is a daemon that stops answering, which the tests found
      by hanging rather than failing.
      **The migration is the riskiest thing here**: `services` is rebuilt for the third origin, and
      the two tables pointing at it would be damaged differently by a drop with foreign keys on —
      `sites.php_service_id` is SET NULL, `site_service_links.service_id` is CASCADE and deletes
      rows leaving nothing about a site to look wrong. `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is a no-op inside a
      transaction, so 0016 is a `-- no-transaction` migration that opens its own.
- [x] **T125** Five more blueprints — `drupal`, `php-mysql`, `rails`, `strapi` and `vite`, taking
      the gallery to eleven. **Chosen by coverage rather than by popularity.** Each closes a gap
      between what this build can run and what the gallery ever asked for: Ruby had six shims and no
      entry, MySQL had a recipe and no entry, and no entry had a `doc_root` that was a build output
      — which is the question this product is asked most often and had no answer for. `memcached`
      stays uncovered on purpose: it is added after a performance problem, never when a project is
      made, and an entry that existed to complete a table is the change the gallery is defined
      against.
      **Only `drupal` carries a command**, which makes it four of eleven. `rails` cannot: `gem
      install rails` writes into a shared runtime, the same rule that removed Django's. `vite` and
      `strapi` cannot either, on the first rule instead of the last — `create-vite` and
      `create-strapi-app` ask questions no flag reliably silences, and a scaffold has no timeout, so
      a job waiting on a prompt waits for good. `php-mysql` has no initialiser to run at all.
      **T124 is what makes a scaffold-free entry complete**: an apply that writes no source code now
      ends at a page that says what is missing, rather than at a 404.
      **The packaging repository needed no change.** `publish-blueprints.yml` globs the gallery
      directory and reconciles the release against what it just signed, so the five arrive by
      re-running it at a ref — an operation, not an edit.
- [x] **T125a** Tell the packaging repository when the gallery changes —
      `.github/workflows/gallery.yml`, one `repository_dispatch` on a push to `master` that touches
      `blueprints/gallery/**` or `blueprints/trust.rs`, and `repository_dispatch` added to
      `check-blueprints.yml` over there. Publishing the signed gallery is done by hand and stays
      that way; what was automatic was only the *discovery* that it had not been, and that ran on a
      weekly cron in a repository nobody had open. **The rule was already written down over there**:
      `check-extensions.yml` fires on a push "because unlike the gallery this input is local", which
      is the one thing a dispatch changes.
      **`ci.yml` could not host it**, and finding that out is what shaped the task: this repository's
      CI fires on a `v*` tag and on nothing else, on the standing rule that a three-OS compile is
      worth a runner only when a person is asking. That rule is about the compile — this job checks
      nothing out and is over in seconds — and it is also the one job here that must not wait to be
      asked for, since being forgotten is the whole failure. `pages.yml` was the precedent for a
      workflow of this repository's own that follows `master`.
      **The cron stays**, because a dispatch that was never sent looks exactly like a gallery nobody
      touched, and only a clock separates those. And the check still reads `mixengine@master` rather
      than the commit in the payload: the claim is "what people can download is what this build
      ships", so a gallery edit reverted a minute later is correctly green. The commit that asked is
      recorded in the summary instead.
      **One thing a person owns**: `PACKAGES_DISPATCH_TOKEN`, since a repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN`
      cannot reach another repository at all. The job fails loudly without it — a notifier that
      quietly does nothing is the same silence as before with a green tick over it.
- [x] **T81a** Publish `extensions.json` from the packaging repository, on T79a's shape: the
      workflow checks this repository out at a ref, renders each `data/extensions/<id>.toml` through
      the reader that verifies it, signs with the index key, and proves the committed `minisign.pub`
      is the one this build compiles in before it signs anything. T81 verifies with a key its own
      tests mint, which is what proves the verification path rather than switching it off — but
      until this lands there is nothing published to install. Design:
      [docs/specs/2026-09-02-t81a-publishing-the-extension-registry-design.md](../specs/2026-09-02-t81a-publishing-the-extension-registry-design.md).
      **The roster lives over there, not here**, which is where this parts company with T79a: that
      task read its manifests out of a `mixengine` checkout because the gallery *is* compiled into
      the binary and a copy would have made two galleries. Nothing of the sort holds for extensions
      — no manifest is compiled in, `manifest::read` is a format rather than a roster, and what an
      entry describes is a third-party artifact at a URL with a hash, which is what that repository
      already exists to describe. A Mailpit version bump has no business being an application
      release.
      **The key chain is held rather than scraped.** `tools/blueprints.py` pulls `PUBLIC_KEY` out of
      `trust.rs` with a regex and has to carry a failure mode for the regex missing; the generator
      here is compiled *from the checkout being published*, so the constant it compares
      `minisign.pub` against is the constant that build checks with. Nothing to scrape, and no branch
      for the scrape failing — T79a's D3 with the moving part removed.
      **One rule and not two.** "Two files may not claim one id" was written into the design and then
      not implemented, because `<id>.toml` already implies it: a directory holds one `mailpit.toml`.
      Writing the check anyway would have been a branch no input can reach. The testkit's
      `sendmail.toml` declares `sendmail-to-mailpit`, so it is a ready-made case for the stem rule
      rather than a fixture the roster could take.
      **The empty document is published now** rather than waiting for T82 to have something to lose.
      A dry run rehearses everything except the four things that actually break — the secret, the
      tag, the asset URL and the download-and-verify — so they are exercised while the cost of
      getting them wrong is nothing, and `mix extension available` answers "no extensions" instead of
      an index error from the day this merges.
      Found on the way: `Timestamp::parse` was private and reachable only through `Deserialize`. A
      generator has to *make* a timestamp, and this workspace has no date library on purpose, so the
      type grew `FromStr` and the shell's `date -u` writes the text.
- [x] **T81b** The site a `web-app` extension is served on — design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-03-t81b-extension-sites-design.md](../specs/2026-09-03-t81b-extension-sites-design.md).
      `sites` gains an exclusive second parent, `extension_id`, on a fourth rebuild of the table — by
      copy, `-- no-transaction`, and with the two sharing triggers written back, because a drop takes
      a table's triggers with it and a missing trigger fails silently; the seeded test asserts the
      refusal, not the row. `SiteOwner` replaces `project_id` in core and `project` on the wire, and
      `doc_root` keeps one meaning: relative to the owner's root. **Two things this task found wrong
      in what it was handed.** T80 said `[web-app].domain` is one label and never checked it, so
      `pma.tools` would have become `pma.tools.mixengine.test`; it is refused at parse now. And the
      daemon's `Extensions` had never regenerated anything after an install — harmless for a
      `service`, whose `extension.start` walks `service.start`, and a site nothing would have served —
      so `Extensions` is built after `Sites` and holds it, with the registry client built in `main`
      where the `Fetcher` is, for the same fail-fast reason. The pool is resolved with the constraint
      alone and confirmed through `pools::of` rather than formatted, frozen at install like a project
      site's, and `runtime.uninstall` names the extension beside the pins it would break. A
      `[web-app.runtime].kind` other than `php` is refused by name: nothing serves another
      language's source, and accepting it would install a manifest whose stated effect does not
      happen. **Found by the daemon test**: the walk validates a staged pool file with `php-fpm
      --test` wherever a PHP publishes `php-fpm`, so a fixture PHP that is only a row fails the very
      regeneration this task adds — `declare::php_pool` points the row at `fakeservice`, which
      already answered `--test --fpm-config` the way php-fpm does.
- [x] **T81c** Wire `[recipe] front_end` fragments — design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-03-t81c-front-end-fragments-design.md](../specs/2026-09-03-t81c-front-end-fragments-design.md).
      Both templates grew their `import`, `swept()` grew a second directory, and T81's refusal by
      name is gone along with `Error::ExtensionRecipeUnsupported` — a check that always returns `Ok`
      reads as if it were checking something. **`server` is required on every fragment, and it names
      a configuration language rather than selecting a file**: the two are not interchangeable, and
      the same value decides how a substituted path is spelled — forward-slashed for nginx, whose
      `ngx_conf_read_token` eats a backslash, and left as this system writes it for Caddy. That
      second half was found by asking what `{install_dir}` becomes on Windows, and it is why
      `Role::FrontEnd` now *carries* its server rather than being joined to one by package name.
      **The refusal moved from the field to the judgement**: `Generator::would_serve` renders the
      front end with the prospective fragment and shows it to `caddy validate` / `nginx -t` through
      a new `document::judge` — `install` without the install — and the daemon calls it **before the
      download**, which is T81's D2 one field further along. Nothing needs the artifact on disk: a
      substitution does not touch the filesystem and neither checker opens a `root`.
      **Found by the first test written.** A brace is the destination language's punctuation:
      `location / { return 404; }` and Caddy's own `{host}` are spelled exactly like our
      placeholders, so the T80 rule that an unknown `{…}` is a mistake cannot hold inside a fragment.
      It is the one field where an unrecognised placeholder is copied verbatim, and what takes over
      the job of catching a misspelling is the front end's parser at install time.
      **And the first version of that was wrong, which a real nginx found and two unit tests did
      not.** A `{` that opens no placeholder of ours has to be emitted and the scan continue *one
      character on*, not past the `}` it was looking for: after `server {` the nearest `}` is
      `{listen}`'s, so consuming through it swallowed the span, re-emitted it verbatim and left
      `{listen}` in the file — `directive "listen" is not terminated by ";"`, four lines from
      anything that looks wrong. Re-emitting a swallowed span is lossless whenever nothing inside it
      needed substituting, so Caddy's fragment — which opens its block after its placeholders —
      rendered correctly by luck and went green on all three systems.
      **The escape hatch is now an invariant with a test.** A fragment accepted at install can be
      refused later — an upgraded front end, or the other one after a switch — and in that state
      nothing regenerates; the way out is `extension.uninstall`, which works only because it removes
      the row *before* anything renders. That order was true by accident of T81b; the comment and the
      suites in `tests/{caddy,nginx}.rs` are what would notice it being swapped.
      **The fifth testkit fixture the design asked for was not written**: `mixengine-core` is not a
      dependency of `mix`, so the CLI suites already write their manifests inline, and the core tests
      that needed one wanted a fragment per server rather than a product's manifest.
      **What this does not buy**: nothing in T82 declares a fragment, and at the top level one can
      only be a snippet, a site block, a `map` or an `upstream` — never something reaching inside the
      site blocks MixEngine renders. This is a declared field made to take effect, which is the debt
      T81 took on when it refused the field by name rather than ignoring it.
- [x] **T82** First extensions: Mailpit `1.31.0`, phpMyAdmin `5.2.3`, Adminer `6.0.1` — design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-03-t82-first-extensions-design.md](../specs/2026-09-03-t82-first-extensions-design.md).
      The archive's top-level directory is the manifest's to name, as this line said; **the other
      three things the real artifacts wanted were not in it**. `[web-app].template` cannot be *a file
      inside the extension*, because a registry install's files are upstream's archive verified
      against upstream's hash — so `[web-app.config]` carries the text, and it is written into the
      served root because `libraries/vendor_config.php` fixes `configFile` at `ROOT_PATH` with no
      override. `[web-app.database]` declares the engines an interface can administer and freezes one
      into `site_service_links`, which arms `service.delete`'s **existing** refusal — the first draft
      of the design added a second one before noticing `sites::declaring` already reads links. And
      Adminer publishes **one PHP file**, so `Installer` learned that a URL naming no archive is one
      file when an extension says so and a refusal when the package index does.
      **No password reaches disk**: `auth_type = 'cookie'` with the server, port and account filled
      in, because `mix database` answers where a credential is stored rather than the credential and
      `SecretFile` exists only to take one off disk again. `{secret}` — phpMyAdmin's
      `blowfish_secret` — is a keyring entry, since it must be stable and a generated file may never
      be read back into state.
      **Three things running it found that reading could not.** T81 wrote `[recipe] php_ini` at boot
      and after a runtime install and nowhere else, so `sendmail_path` appeared only after a restart;
      the install now rewrites the ini set, which is T81c's lesson arriving for the other half of
      `[recipe]`. Adminer's hook is `function_exists('adminer_object')` — a *global* name — called
      from inside `namespace Adminer`, so a wrapper written from the sources is never called and one
      written without namespaces dies on `Class "Adminer" not found`; it takes a global function
      extending `\Adminer\Adminer`. And the manifest cited a `mix service credentials` that does not
      exist.
- [x] **T82a** phpMyAdmin signs itself in — design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-03-t82a-a-pool-of-the-extensions-own-design.md](../specs/2026-09-03-t82a-a-pool-of-the-extensions-own-design.md).
      A php-fpm pool of the extension's own, carrying an `EnvValue::Keyring` the supervisor resolves
      at spawn, so the database superuser's password is in one process's environment, on no disk,
      and in no other project's. `features/extensions.md`'s second acceptance criterion is whole.
      **Every `web-app` gets one, not only the ones that ask**, and that is the task's first
      decision rather than its obvious reading: a manifest field must not decide what runs on the
      machine — an extension that grew `signs_in` in a later release would quietly restructure its
      own install — and the isolation belongs to the *kind*, since five shared workers and an
      administrative interface walking a large schema is a fact about `web-app` whether or not a
      credential is involved. Two shapes would also be two shapes at every site that installs,
      uninstalls, repairs and refuses.
      **The variable's name is not the manifest's to write.** The first draft had
      `password_env = "…"` and then grew a shape check, a refusal of the three names the pool sets
      itself, and a per-OS list of names that would break a program outright — in a crate that may
      not ask what OS it is on. T80's D2 had already answered it for addresses, so `signs_in` is a
      boolean, the variable is `MIXENGINE_DB_PASSWORD`, and a manifest reaches it through
      `{db_password_env}`: no name to collide with, and therefore no check to forget. `signs_in`
      with no `{db_password_env}` in the configuration text is refused at parse — consent bought for
      nothing is consent nobody should be asked for, and it is the one rule this format has that
      spans two tables.
      **`clear_env = no` is the only route that does not put the value on disk**: php-fpm clears a
      worker's environment unless told otherwise, and `env[NAME] = …` performs no expansion. It is
      rendered for the pool that carries a credential and for no other, which is the assertion worth
      more than the rest of the task.
      **Three things this found in what it was handed.** `pools::of` answered one `ServiceId` per
      runtime and had to become `of_runtime`, plural, or `runtime.uninstall` would delete the shared
      pool, leave the extension's, and then meet `ON DELETE RESTRICT` as a message about a column —
      and `pools::ensure`'s predicate had to narrow with it, since an extension's pool satisfied
      "any service on this runtime" while being no use to a project site. The pool's socket was
      spelled from the runtime *version*, which is the same string as the instance for every pool
      that existed and is not for this one; spelling it from the instance moves no existing home's
      path. And a pool naming a keyring entry that does not exist refuses to spawn — a database's
      credential is written by that database's *first run* — so the pool declares an edge to it,
      derived by the generator from the link and never by the manifest, which T80's D9 refuses for
      its own reasons.
      **The hole this opens is closed in the same task**: `mix site update --pool php-fpm@phpmyadmin`
      would put a project's PHP in the process holding the password, so `sites::create` and
      `sites::update` refuse an extension's pool to anybody else's site — in core, because
      `blueprint.apply` reaches `update` without a CLI. The credential resolution fails closed
      besides. **Adminer keeps its login form**: phpMyAdmin publishes a supported signed-in mode and
      Adminer does not, and guessing at an unsupported seam for a credential this consequential is
      not a trade this task takes — its manifest needs one line the day upstream grows one.
- [x] **T83** **The standalone client integration** — design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-03-t83-a-connection-handed-to-the-window-design.md](../specs/2026-09-03-t83-a-connection-handed-to-the-window-design.md).
      A `DesktopApps` capability on `Host` — find by the manifest's per-OS hint, start with an
      environment — and two methods: `database.client`, which answers per service what a client
      would speak and whether one is here as **three states, none an error** (`installed`,
      `not_installed` with where the system looked, `no_client`), and `database.open`, which
      starts the instance on `database.create`'s road, reads the account's password from the
      keyring at that moment and starts the located binary directly with a `<old>://` URL as its
      argument and the password in **that process's environment alone** — `MIXENGINE_DB_PASSWORD`,
      T82a's name, named in the URL so the contract describes itself. **The scheme is a wire format,
      not a dispatch**: handing the URL to the OS could not carry the environment and would hand a
      credential to whatever program registered `<old>://`, which the standalone client has not yet and any program
      could. **Measured, and the reason the Windows lookup changed**: Tauri's NSIS installer writes
      no App Paths entry — this machine's the standalone client is `Uninstall\the standalone client` with
      `DisplayIcon = "…\<old>.exe"` — so the hint stays a file name and the uninstall table is read
      too, case-insensitively. **A clean exit inside the one-second judgement is `handed_on`** rather
      than a failure, because that is what a single-instance application does when a copy is already
      running, and a design that read it as failure would fail on the commonest case; a non-zero
      exit is `process_failed` with the program's path. One reaper thread takes the children a
      long-lived daemon would otherwise leave as zombies on Unix. Redis is opened with no account
      and no variable, and `--user` on it is refused; memcached is "not a database a desktop client
      opens" — a state to `client`, a refusal to `open`. The (P) proof is `cli/tests/database.rs`
      asking each system's own lookup for an application no machine has; the credential's path is
      proved once, on Linux, by a script that records presence and never value. What `<old>` owes
      is a contract in `features/extensions.md`: read the URL, read the variable, forget the
      variable, open the tab. **(P)**
- [x] **T84** **The standalone client as a `desktop-app` registry entry + a shared keyring naming convention** —
      design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-04-t84-the-window-in-the-registry-and-one-keyring-design.md](../specs/2026-09-04-t84-the-window-in-the-registry-and-one-keyring-design.md).
      **The entry names no artifact, and that absence *is* the entry** — which overturns
      `features/extensions.md`'s *"the standalone client's own release artifacts … so users can install it from
      inside MixEngine"*, on three grounds each sufficient alone. There is nothing to unpack: the standalone client
      publishes an NSIS installer, a disk image, an AppImage and a Debian package, and `Installer`
      verifies a hash and unpacks an archive. Running a downloaded installer would be arbitrary code
      arriving through the door built for supervised services, which is `mixengine-elevate`'s
      boundary read backwards. And the standalone client updates itself, so a version MixEngine installed would be
      permanently behind the one on the machine with nothing able to tell them apart. So a
      `desktop-app` entry carries how to *find* an application somebody else installed, and its
      `version` is **the entry's** rather than the machine's — which is why `extension.plan` grew
      `client`, `installed { program }` or `not_installed { searched }`, filled for that kind and no
      other, and `homepage` beside it. An install that wrote a row and an empty directory is
      otherwise a success that produced nothing a person can see, and the only state explaining it
      lived behind `database.client`, which needs a database to ask about. The hints are what the
      three installers actually write — `<old>.exe`, `io.github.haiquang9994.<old>`,
      `<old>.desktop` — and an AppImage nobody integrated is `not_installed`, honestly.
      **The namespace is the convention; the key is the message.** T83 measured that the standalone client
      registered no URL scheme; it now declares `deep-link` for `<old>`, so a `<old>://` URL is
      something any web page can make the user's own the standalone client receive — and that one expired
      measurement is what shapes the whole second half. A URL allowed to name the *credential
      store's namespace* would be a way to read any secret on the machine and post it to a
      stranger's server as a password, so `mixengine` is compiled in on both sides and never
      travels; only the key does, as `secret_key`, which reaches no entry a forged `label` and
      `user` could not reach anyway. That is also why `password_env` may travel and this may not: a
      variable exists only in a process MixEngine started, and a keyring entry is always there.
      **`KEYRING_SERVICE` moved to `mixengine-proto`** — the layer that owns the wire — and
      `mixengine-platform` re-exports it, so no caller changed; `database.create`, `database.client`
      and `database.open` answer `secret: { service, key }`, because a client composing the other
      half is the second copy this task exists to delete. `client` composes the address from the
      recipe and still reads nothing, which is what makes the convention askable before anything is
      opened. **And three compositions became one**: `Context::secret_address`, the handoff's and
      the daemon's now all call `services::handoff::secret_key`, since a rule published to another
      application must not be `format!`s that agree by inspection. What `<old>` owes is the
      receiver's half — save the address and not the password, honour a reference only from a
      handoff that arrived on `argv` of a fresh process, ask again when the entry is gone — and
      `mixnz/mixengine-packages` owes `data/extensions/<old>.toml`, the same file as the fixture.

- [x] **T77b** A password a person can read, and a password a person chooses — design in
      [docs/specs/2026-09-06-t77b-a-password-a-person-can-read-and-choose-design.md](../specs/2026-09-06-t77b-a-password-a-person-can-read-and-choose-design.md).
      T77a's D11 answered one consumer of a database credential — a process MixEngine starts — and
      left no way for a person to get one into a project's `.env`. `mix database credentials`
      reads what is stored; `mix database create --password` lets a person choose one instead of
      generating it, through the same ownership rule (`decide`) a generated password already goes
      through — a correct password for an account MixEngine holds no keyring entry for is still
      refused, because knowing a password is not the deed. **The rule for a credential on the
      wire got its own decision** — [ADR 0025](../decisions/0025-a-credential-is-answered-only-by-a-method-that-exists-to-answer-it.md)
      — since T77a's "never the password" and this task's "this one method answers nothing else"
      are two rules that needed to be told apart rather than left to collide silently the next time
      somebody adds a field. **(P)**

**Milestone M8** — capture a project as a blueprint, apply it to a new one, open its database in
The standalone client, and test it from a phone.
