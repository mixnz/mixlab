//! Where a platform failure becomes the error `mix` prints.
//!
//! The daemon has a boundary like this one and it is deliberately not shared. The two map the same
//! enum for different readers: `mixengine-daemon` turns a failure into something a *client* is told
//! about, while this turns one into something the person who typed the command is told about — and
//! the advice differs at exactly the interesting points. A refused endpoint means "another daemon
//! is already running" to the daemon that could not bind it, and "the home you asked about belongs
//! to somebody else" to a client that could not dial it.
//!
//! What the two do share is [`mixengine_proto::flatten`], because the shape of the message is a
//! property of the wire error rather than of either binary.
//!
//! Only the failures a client can genuinely reach are classified here. `mix` binds nothing, runs no
//! external tool and asks the platform layer for exactly three things — the default home, the
//! endpoint address for a home, and a connection to it.
