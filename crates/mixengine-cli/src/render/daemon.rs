/// second time here — a service that would not stop reads the same in both places, and two renderings
/// of one failure eventually disagree about it.
///
/// A daemon with nothing to stop says only the first line. `service_walk`'s "this home declares no
/// services" is the right sentence for a command that was *about* services and the wrong one here,
/// where nothing was asked about them.
///
/// **A shutdown that could not be ordered says so before anything else**, because the two answers
/// are otherwise the same one: an empty walk from a home with nothing to stop, and an empty walk
/// from a daemon that could not work out how to stop what it had. The second is the one a user has
/// to know about — everything went down at the same moment instead of dependents first — and the
/// only reason this can say it is that [`DaemonShutdown::unordered`] carries the reason. Rendered as
/// the daemon's own sentence, hint and all, rather than reworded here: the file to fix is named in
/// it, and `mix service list` will complain about that same file in those same words.
