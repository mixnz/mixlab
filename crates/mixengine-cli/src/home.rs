//! Which home this `mix` is talking about, and where that home's daemon listens.
//!
//! Both answers have to come out the same as the daemon's or the two would be talking past each
//! other, and the daemon reaches them through `mixengine_core::Paths`. This client does not: `core`
//! carries `sqlx`, and linking a bundled SQLite into `mix` to learn where a socket goes is not a
//! trade worth making — `mix` is the binary that has to start in milliseconds because a person is
//! waiting for it. So the two rules it needs are restated here, and
//! [`tests/status.rs`](../tests/status.rs) starts a real daemon and a real client against one
//! temporary home to prove they still agree.
