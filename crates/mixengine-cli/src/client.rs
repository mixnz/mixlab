//!
//! **The protocol is checked before anything is believed.** `daemon.version` is the first call, as
//! [`DaemonVersion`] says it should be: a daemon from another release may answer `daemon.status`
//! with a shape this build cannot decode, and finding that out by failing to parse the answer would
//! tell the user "the daemon said something unreadable" when the truth is "these two binaries are
//! from different releases". One extra round trip over a local socket is microseconds, and it is
//! the difference between a diagnosis and a shrug.
