//! Starting a daemon for a home that has none.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md`: *if a client cannot connect, it spawns
//! `mixengined --detach`, which returns only once the daemon answers on its endpoint.* That is the
//! whole of the mechanism, and the reason it is this short is that the waiting belongs on the other
//! side — the process that knows whether its child is still alive is the one that started it, so
//! there is no backoff loop here and no readiness probe. `--detach` exiting zero *is* the readiness
//! probe.
//!
//! Nothing here is asynchronous. `Command::output` blocks until the daemon is up, which on a
//! current-thread runtime with no other task pending is exactly the wait we want and is one fewer
//! moving part than a `tokio::process` child polled by a runtime that has nothing else to do.
//!
//! **Reading that child to end-of-file needs one thing arranged first, and it is not obvious.**
//! Roadmap task T9 found that a daemon started with `--detach` inherited the pipe its caller's
//! stdout was on, and fixed it inside `spawn_detached` — which is one copy too late for the caller
//! *this* module is. Inheritance on Windows is transitive: `mix`'s own stdout reaches
//! `mixengined --detach` the moment it is spawned, and that process passes it on to the daemon
//! before `spawn_detached` gets a say. Whatever is reading `mix` — a shell script, `cargo test`,
//! the GUI — then waits for an end-of-file that arrives when the daemon exits, days later. So the
//! spawn below is wrapped in [`process::hide_stdio_from_children`], which is `mix` declining to
//! hand on what it was handed. Found exactly the way T9's was: as a `mix status` that returned
//! promptly and a test that never did.
