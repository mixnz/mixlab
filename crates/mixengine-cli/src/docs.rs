//! `mix docs` — the handbook, from the copy compiled into this binary.
//!
//! **No daemon, no home, no socket.** The command is answered before a client exists, because the
//! page somebody most needs is the one that explains why nothing starts. What it prints is the
//! page's Markdown, byte for byte: the same document the site serves at `/<locale>/<slug>.md`, so a
//! person and a program reading either receive the same thing — roadmap task T90, and ADR 0021 for
//! why this is not an API method.
//!
//! No colour and no renderer, which is [`crate::render`]'s rule and, here, also the design: a
//! rendering would be a second telling of a document this crate does not own.
