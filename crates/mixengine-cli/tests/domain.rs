//! `mix domain` against a real daemon.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T46**'s client half. What the daemon's own `tests/sites.rs` proves is that the
//! three methods do what they say; what is proved here is the part only `mix` can be wrong about —
//! that the flags a person types reach the right method, and that a diagnostic a person reads is a
//! rendering of what the daemon answered rather than a second opinion assembled in the client.
//!
//! **The negative half of this file needs a control.** A test concluding something from a name that
//! did *not* resolve, without proving in the same run and with the same instrument that a name which
//! must resolve does, is making a claim about `getaddrinfo` rather than about the machine. Four of
//! the six measurement rounds behind T45 were void for exactly that (T46 design, D9).
