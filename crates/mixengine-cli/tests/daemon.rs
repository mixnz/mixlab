//! `mix daemon stop` against a real daemon, with a real service under it.
//!
//! Task **T9a**, and the reason it is an end-to-end test rather than a unit one: everything below
//! the client is proved where it lives — the handler stops the services before it cancels anything,
//! the budget bounds the sum — and what none of that proves is that a person typing three words is
//! left with no daemon. That claim is about a process ending, so nothing here is mocked and the
//! assertion is `Daemon::wait_until_gone`.
//!
//! **The ones that declare a service are ignored in a release build**, for the reason `service.rs`
//! gives at length: the only recipe a `fakeservice` row can be rendered by is compiled into debug
//! builds alone, so a release run would assert against a home that declares nothing and would pass
//! or fail for reasons that have nothing to do with `mix daemon stop`. That covers the two about a
//! shutdown nobody could order as well — an undeclarable source needs a service to be undeclarable,
//! and this build can declare one only in debug.
//! What holds in a release run is the layer below: `api/rpc.rs` drives the same case through
//! `fixture::Unavailable`, and `render.rs` proves the sentence it produces.
