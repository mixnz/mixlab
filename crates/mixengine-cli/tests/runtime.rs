//! `mix runtime` and `mix job` against a real daemon, a real signed index and a real archive.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T23**'s client half. What the daemon's own `tests/runtimes.rs` proves is that the
//! methods do what they say; what is proved here is the part that is only true of `mix` — that the
//! two arguments a person types reach the right method, that an install *waits* by default and ends
//! with an exit status a shell can branch on, and that both renderings say what happened.
//!
//! **Multi-threaded on purpose.** `MockRegistry` is serving the daemon that `mix` is talking to, in
//! this same process, while `mix` runs to completion as a blocking child — so the server and the
//! wait cannot share a thread. Nothing here touches the network: a loopback socket and a named pipe
//! are neither.
