//! `mix path` against a real `mixengined` — roadmap task **T26**.
//!
//! **Only the read is end to end, and that is deliberate rather than a gap.** `path.install` writes
//! the PATH of the account running it: on Windows a value in this user's registry hive, on both
//! others a marked block in their shell profiles. A suite that called it would be a `cargo test`
//! that edits the environment of whoever ran it, on a developer's laptop and on a CI runner that
//! keeps its home directory between jobs. So the two mutations are proved where they can be proved
//! against something the test owns: the real ones in `mixengine-platform`, against a registry key
//! and a home directory each test creates and deletes, and the dispatch and the wire shape in
//! `mixengine-daemon`'s own tests against `mock::Host`.
//!
//! What is left for this file is the half nothing else covers, and it is not a small half: that a
//! real daemon **fills `bin/` on the way up** without being asked, that `mix path status` reads the
//! real machine and answers, and that what it reports is what is actually in the directory.
//!
//! **The table is never restated here.** `mixengine-core` is not a dependency of `mix` and is not
//! made one for a test: what is asserted is that the daemon's answer and the directory agree, plus
//! `php` by name — which is the one command Phase 2's milestone is about.
