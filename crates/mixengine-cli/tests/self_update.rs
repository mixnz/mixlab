//! `mix self-update` end to end — roadmap task **T88**.
//!
//! **The one test that can exercise the whole sequence**, and it has to be an end-to-end one for a
//! reason no unit test can get around: what an update is *about* is a running daemon replacing the
//! binaries it and its client are executing, and then a different process coming up out of them.
//! Every part of that is proved where it lives — the feed's verification in `core::index`, the swap
//! and its rollback in `core::updates::apply`, the refusals in `api/rpc.rs` — and none of it proves
//! that a person typing two words ends up running the new build with the same services up.
//!
//! **So this copies `mix` and `mixengined` into a directory of its own** and drives them from there.
//! A test that swapped the binaries in `target/debug` would replace the ones `cargo test` is running
//! the rest of the suite out of.
//!
//! **The payload is this build's own binaries under a version the feed calls newer**, which makes
//! the last assertion possible rather than being a corner cut: a test cannot compile a binary with a
//! different `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`, so the release that comes up is the one that was already running —
//! and the post-restart check is written to notice exactly that and stop offering the release. The
//! payload being the same version is therefore a **pass** of this test rather than a hole in it.
//!
//! Nothing here is `#[ignore]`d for the network: the feed is served in-process and the payload is a
//! served asset. What *is* ignored in a release build is the half that needs a service, for
//! `daemon.rs`' reason — the `fakeservice` recipe is compiled into debug builds alone.
