//! A home serving real PHP through a real front end — roadmap task **T72a**.
//!
//! **The arrangement nothing in this repository had until now.** `caddy.rs` proves a rendering the
//! server accepts, `php_fpm.rs` proves a pool that executes a script, and neither of them ever made
//! an HTTP request that reached PHP *through* Caddy. Two suites need exactly that and would
//! otherwise each build it: the one that proves a pool's status page cannot be asked for from
//! outside, and the cold-path budget.
//!
//! **One PHP or several, and the versions are read off the binaries rather than written down.**
//! `MIXENGINE_PHP_RUNTIMES` holds one or more unpacked PHP directories, separated the way this
//! system separates a `PATH`; `MIXENGINE_PHP_RUNTIME` is read as a list of one when it is not set,
//! which is what the `test` job already provides. Asking `php --version` for the number means an
//! index entry describes the artifact it is actually pointing at — a suite that hard-coded a version
//! beside a directory would publish 8.3.33 for whatever somebody unpacked there.
