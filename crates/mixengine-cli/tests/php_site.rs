//! A PHP site, reached the way a person reaches one — roadmap task **T72a**.
//!
//! **The first request in this repository that goes through the front end and comes back from PHP.**
//! `caddy.rs` proves a rendering the server accepts and `php_fpm.rs` proves a pool that executes a
//! script; between them was the claim neither makes, which is that a browser pointed at a site gets
//! that pool's answer.
//!
//! # Why it exists now
//!
//! T72a renders `pm.status_path` into every pool file, so php-fpm publishes its own status page on
//! the socket a site's traffic arrives on. What separates the two is a *name*: both front ends hand
//! FastCGI only what matches `.php`, and the status path deliberately does not — so no URL can
//! produce a `SCRIPT_NAME` equal to it.
//!
//! **That was an argument, and this is the measurement.** It is the assertion that lets the pool file
//! carry the directive at all: if a site can be asked for its pool's status page, the arrangement is
//! wrong and no amount of prose fixes it.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped, for `caddy.rs`' reason: a test that quietly returns when it
//! finds no PHP is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download broke.
