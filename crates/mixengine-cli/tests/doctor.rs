//! `mix doctor` against a real daemon.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T47a**'s client half. What the daemon's own `tests/api.rs` proves is that the
//! checks answer; what is proved here is the part only `mix` can be wrong about — that every check
//! reaches the screen, and that the exit code is the *report* rather than the call.
//!
//! **The assertion that matters is that a check can fail.** A suite that only ever sees a healthy
//! machine has proved that the doctor runs, not that it looks — so each `Ok` here is paired, in the
//! same test, with the arrangement that turns it into a `Problem` (T47a design, D10).
//!
//! **And nothing here may assume the machine running it is well.** The first version of this file
//! did, and CI answered: the GitHub Windows runner has **port 80 inside a reserved range**, so
//! `mix doctor` correctly reports a problem on a home with nothing in it. That is the check doing
//! its job — a front end on that machine genuinely could not bind 80 — so what was wrong was the
//! test's premise, not the finding. Each assertion below therefore names the condition it is about
//! and ignores every other, which isolates the variable instead of demanding a pristine machine.
