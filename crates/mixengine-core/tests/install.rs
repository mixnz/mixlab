//! The install pipeline against real archives served over a real socket.

//! last of them written by a different implementation than the product reads it with. A double that
//! handed back a directory would answer by construction the three questions this pipeline exists to
//! ask: does the checksum decide anything, does an archive get to choose where its bytes land, and
//! does anything half-finished ever appear where a client will look.
//!
//! The invariant every test here is a restatement of is
//! [runtime-versions.md](../../../docs/features/runtime-versions.md)'s: **a half-extracted version
//! must never appear in `list`**. So each failing path asserts the absence of the destination, not
