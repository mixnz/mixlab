//! The `packages` table, and where on disk a server, a database or a cache is unpacked.
//!
//! [`crate::runtimes`] one table across, and deliberately the same shape: this module owns every
//! write to `packages` and nothing else, and the ordering every caller follows is the same one —
//! install into place, *then* write the row; remove the directory, *then* delete the row. The
//! reasoning is [`crate::runtimes`]' own and is not repeated here.
//!
//! # What is different, and why
//!
//! **There is no default version.** A runtime has one because a program called `php` has to resolve
//! to something with nobody present to ask; a service instance names its version in its own row, so
//! there is nothing left to decide. That removes the transaction [`crate::runtimes::remember`]
//! needs — a single insert is atomic on its own.
//!
//! **A row can be held.** `services.package_id` is `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, so a package with an
//! instance is one nothing may remove; [`holders`] is what turns that constraint into a sentence
//! naming the services, and [`PackageSummary::services`] is what puts it in the listing rather than
//! only in the failure.
//!
//! **What knows how to *run* a package is not here.** Which executable proves an install works is
//! [`Recipe::smoke_test`](crate::generate::Recipe::smoke_test) — a fact about Caddy, held beside the
//! template that configures it — where the runtime equivalent is a `match` in
//! [`crate::runtimes::smoke_test`] because a runtime has no recipe to hold it.
