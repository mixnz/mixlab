//! `mixengine.toml` — the file a project pins its runtimes in, read and written in one place.
//!
//! **One reader** (spec D9). [`crate::resolve`] used to deserialise a deliberately narrow struct of
//! its own: `[runtimes]` and nothing else. T39 needs `[project] name` on import and a writer for
//! export, and two structs describing one file would be two answers to one question — so the narrow
//! one is gone and `resolve` is a caller.
//!
//! **Unknown sections are still allowed through.** `[site]` and `[[services]]` have types as of
//! T39a, and `[[sites]]` as of T204, but the file also has to hold what T43 and Phase 8 will add, and a `deny_unknown_fields`
//! here would make this build refuse the manifests those tasks write. What is still closed is the
//! map inside `[runtimes]` — a key naming a language MixEngine does not manage is a pin that would
//! silently do nothing — and the two typed sections' own required keys.
//!
//! # The writer edits; it does not rewrite
//!
//! This file lives in the user's repository, under version control, with their comments and their
//! key order in it — and, after T39a, a `[site]` block they wrote by hand. Serialising a fresh
//! document over it would destroy all of that, and would do it to the one file whose entire purpose
//! is to be read by a person. So [`write()`] edits a `toml_edit` document: it sets `[project] name`
//! and the `[runtimes]` keys it owns, and leaves every other byte alone.
