//! Getting an artifact the index names onto this machine — completely, or not at all.
//!
//! # The whole of it is one transaction, and the rename is the commit
//!
//! `docs/features/runtime-versions.md` states the invariant this module exists to hold: *a
//! half-extracted version must never appear in `list`*. So nothing is written where a reader will
//! look for it. The archive is unpacked into a staging directory beside the destination, everything
//! that could still refuse it happens there — the paths it promised are checked, the binary is made
//! to actually start — and only then is the directory renamed into place, which the operating system
//! does atomically or not at all. Any failure removes the staging directory and leaves the
//! destination as if nothing had been attempted.
//!
//! That ordering is why the post-install check lives here rather than in whatever calls this. Run
//! after the rename it would be a test of something already installed, and its failure would have
//! nothing to undo without deleting a directory a client may already have been told about.
//!
//! # A download survives the process that started it, and an install does not
//!
//! The two halves are deliberately unlike. The `.part` file is named after the hash the index
//! promises, lives in `cache/downloads/` and is *kept* across a failure, a cancellation and a daemon
//! restart, so asking again resumes rather than starts over — which for an eighty-megabyte artifact
//! on a bad connection is the difference between a feature and a wish. The staging directory is the
//! opposite: it belongs to one attempt and is removed by anything that goes wrong, including the
//! next attempt finding one left behind by a daemon that was killed.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! **No job, and no method.** This is the mechanism; `runtime.install` is [T23]'s, on the same split
//! T19a/T19b and T22 used, and [`Watcher`] is shaped exactly like the daemon's `JobHandle` so that
//! wiring the two together is an impl and not an adapter. **No per-runtime knowledge** either: what
//! to run as a smoke test arrives as a [`SmokeTest`], because "which flag prints the version" is a
//! fact about PHP and Node, not about downloading.
//!
