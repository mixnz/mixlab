//! The php-fpm pool a `web-app` extension's site runs on — roadmap task **T82a**.
//!
//! # Why a pool of its own, for every `web-app` and not only the ones that ask for a password
//!
//! The design's D1. A manifest field must not decide whether an extension gets a process of its
//! own: one that grew `signs_in` in a later release would, on the next install, quietly stop
//! sharing a pool and start owning one — a change to what runs on the machine, arriving from a
//! document rather than from a decision.
//!
//! And the isolation belongs to the *kind*. A `web-app` is an administrative interface onto this
//! machine's own databases, served on a runtime MixEngine picks rather than the user's; today it
//! competes for the five workers of the `[www]` pool with every site somebody is actually
//! developing. That is true whether or not a credential is involved.
//!
//! What it costs is one php-fpm master per installed `web-app`, and that is bounded by machinery
//! that already exists: a pool is idle-stopped after half an hour ([`Recipe::idle_default`], T70's
//! D9) and woken by the request that needs it.
//!
//! # The id is derived and the row is confirmed
//!
//! [`id`] composes `php-fpm@<extension-id>`, which is the rule a `service` extension's process
//! already follows one step along — there the process *is* `<id>`. [`of`] reads the row back before
//! anything names it, because T81b paid once already for the difference between formatting an id
//! and having one.
//!
//! # And it is not a pool anybody else may name
//!
//! [`crate::sites`] refuses it to a site that is not this extension's — the design's D5 — because a
//! project's PHP inside this process would be a project's PHP able to read a database superuser's
//! password.
//!
