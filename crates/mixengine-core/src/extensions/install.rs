//! Putting an extension on this machine — roadmap task **T81**.
//!
//! # The order, and why it is that order
//!
//! 1. Read the manifest — from the verified registry, or from a directory for `--path`.
//! 2. Refuse what this home cannot serve, **before anything is fetched** — roadmap task **T81c**.
//!    A `[[recipe.front_end]]` fragment is rendered into this home's front-end configuration and
//!    judged by the front end's own binary, and a fragment it will not parse stops the install here.
//!    That check is the daemon's, because a [`Generator`](crate::generate::Generator) is where the
//!    recipe catalogue and this system's port mapping already are; what used to stand in this step
//!    was T81's refusal of the field by name, which this task replaced by making it work.
//! 3. Ask. [`plan`] is what a person answers, and it carries the permissions the manifest declares.
//! 4. Download, verify the SHA-256, unpack into staging, rename into place — [`crate::install`]
//!    whole, which is the same transaction a runtime install is.
//! 5. Allocate the ports, write the rows — the service row for a `service`, the site row for a
//!    `web-app` (roadmap task **T81b**).
//!
//! **Consent comes before the download** (the T81 design's D2), and that is what carrying manifests
//! in the registry buys: the question *"this wants to reach the LAN and read your project roots —
//! go on?"* can be asked before a byte of artifact arrives. Asking afterwards is asking after doing
//! the thing somebody was about to refuse.
//!
//! # What a half-install leaves behind
//!
//! Nothing. The archive is unpacked into a staging directory beside the destination and renamed in
//! only once everything that could still refuse it has not — which is [`crate::install`]'s
//! invariant, inherited here rather than restated. The rows are written after that, so a failure
//! at any point leaves a home that has never heard of this extension.
