//! The one file MixEngine generates for a `web-app` — roadmap task **T82**, the design's D1 and D2.
//!
//! # Why it lives inside the install directory
//!
//! Because the application says so. phpMyAdmin's `libraries/vendor_config.php` fixes
//! `'configFile' => ROOT_PATH . 'config.inc.php'` — measured, not assumed — with no environment
//! variable and no search path, so there is exactly one place the file can go.
//!
//! That is a smaller trespass than it reads. Nothing in this workspace verifies an install
//! directory after the install, so no integrity claim is broken; `extension.uninstall` removes the
//! directory whole, so the generated file has the lifetime it should; and the file is ours, written
//! from state in SQLite and thrown away, which is the rule `etc/` follows rather than an exception
//! to it.
//!
//! **What a person changes lives in `{data_dir}`**, which outlives an uninstall (T81's D13). A
//! manifest ends its text with an `@include` of a file there; nothing here enforces that it does,
//! because a manifest that did not would simply have no user half.
//!
//! # A database that is gone is a skip, not a rewrite
//!
//! `site_service_links.service_id` cascades, so `mix service delete <db> --force` — the one path
//! that crosses the refusal writing that link armed — leaves a `web-app` whose declared engines
//! resolve to nothing. [`of`] answers [`None`] there and the caller warns; the file already on disk
//! is left alone. Rewriting it to point nowhere would make a forced delete worse in silence, and
//! reading the old value back out of it would be parsing a generated file into state.
