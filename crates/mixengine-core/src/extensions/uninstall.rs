//! Removing an installed extension — roadmap task **T81**, the design's D12.
//!
//! # The reverse of the install, and tolerant of a half-done one
//!
//! Delete the `services` row, forget the extension (which releases its ports by the cascade),
//! remove the install directory, and remove the data directory only if somebody asked. Each step
//! tolerates its predecessor having already happened, because an uninstall interrupted by a daemon
//! restart has to be able to finish rather than refuse: what would otherwise be left is an extension
//! that cannot be installed again and cannot be removed either.
//!
//! # The data directory is kept
//!
//! Unless asked otherwise. It is the one thing here a person cannot get back, and it is why the
//! layout puts it outside the install directory in the first place (D13) — an uninstall that had to
//! delete everything under one root would be one that could not make this promise.
//!
//! **Nothing here stops a process.** Supervision belongs to the daemon, so the order it walks is
//! stop-then-this; what this refuses on its own behalf is the `RESTRICT` on `services.extension_id`,
//! which is the database saying an extension is not removable while something still runs out of it.
