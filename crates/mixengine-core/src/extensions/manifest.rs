//! The `extension.toml` manifest — roadmap task **T80**.
//!
//! **Its own type rather than a [`ServiceSpec`]** (the T80 design, D1), and not as a matter of
//! taste: `ServiceSpec` has sixteen fields where `[service]` has four, it has no `id` — the
//! manifest's author is not naming a service when they write `program` — and every path and address
//! in the file is a *template*. `{install_dir}/mailpit` is not a `PathBuf` any check would accept
//! and `{listen}:{ui_port}` is not a `SocketAddr` at all, so a `Deserialize` that succeeded on this
//! file would be one that had stopped checking. What T77 found for `mixengine.toml`, arriving a
//! second time.
//!
//! What *is* shared is the vocabulary — [`EnvValue`], [`StopBehaviour`], [`RestartPolicy`],
//! [`Millis`], [`VersionConstraint`] — which is what [ADR 0006] asked for, and which is why the rule
//! that a spec cannot express a secret by value costs this module nothing to obey: writing a
//! `value` beside `from = "keyring"` is refused by the type, here as everywhere else.
//!
//! Rendering the templates into the spec is [`super::render`].
//!
//! [`ServiceSpec`]: mixengine_proto::ServiceSpec
