//! The `projects` table: a directory this home has been told about, and the versions it pins.
//!
//! [`crate::packages`]' shape one table across — this module owns every write to `projects` and
//! nothing else — with one addition that is the point of the task: [`find`] is the walk
//! [`crate::resolve`] used to hold privately. Two implementations of "which project is this
//! directory in?" would be two answers to a question that has exactly one, which is the same rule
//! that put `resolve` in this crate to begin with.
//!
//! # One directory is one project, on both sides of the comparison
//!
//! `root_path` is `UNIQUE`, and it is normalised through
//! [`mixengine_platform::paths::in_full`] **before it is written** — that is what makes
//! `C:\Users\RUNNER~1\blog` and `C:\Users\runneradmin\blog` one project rather than two. The query
//! side is normalised as well, once, before the walk starts: a row normalised on the way in and a
//! caller's `cwd` that was not are two different strings for one directory, and step 3 of the
//! resolution order would miss on the very day it first had a row to hit.
//!
//! `in_full` expands 8.3 aliases and settles case. It does **not** follow symlinks or junctions, so
//! two paths reaching one directory through a junction can still register as two projects. That is
//! a known limit rather than an oversight: `std::fs::canonicalize` on Windows answers with a `\\?\`
//! verbatim path, a spelling nothing else in this workspace uses and which would leak into every
//! message and every rendered file.
