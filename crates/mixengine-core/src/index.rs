//! Reading the signed package index: what exists, and where to get it.
//!
//! # One verification path, two sources
//!
//! An index arrives either from the network or from the cache on disk, and **both go through the
//! same function**. Re-verifying a file this process wrote a minute ago looks redundant and is not:
//! the cache is an ordinary file in the user's home that any local process can rewrite, and a client
//! that trusts it because it trusted the network once has moved the trust boundary from "we signed
//! this" to "nothing on this machine touched it". Verification costs a BLAKE2b hash and one Ed25519
//! check over about fifty kilobytes, which is nothing next to the question it answers.
//!
//! # Why the network lives here rather than in the daemon
//!
//! Whether to go to the network at all *is* the cache policy — freshness, staleness and the
//! rollback check are the same decision as "fetch or do not fetch". Splitting them would put the
//! policy in one crate and its trigger in another, and the interesting failures all live in the
//! seam. So this module owns `reqwest` the way [`crate::store`] owns `sqlx`.
//!
//! # TLS
//!
//! `reqwest`'s default rustls path uses [`rustls-platform-verifier`], which delegates to the
//! operating system's own verifier. That is what makes MixEngine work on a machine behind a
//! corporate proxy that installs its own root — where a bundled root store would fail with nothing
//! the user could do about it — and it is what lets `MIXENGINE_MIRROR_URL` point at a team mirror
//! with an internal certificate, which
//! [runtime-packaging.md](../../../docs/operations/runtime-packaging.md) promises.
//!
//! Being permissive there is affordable precisely because TLS is **not** what decides whether an
//! index is ours: the Ed25519 signature is, end to end, and it is checked after the bytes arrive
//! regardless of how they arrived. A proxy that can read the traffic still cannot forge the
//! document.
//!
//! One consequence worth stating before somebody finds it and calls it a hole: from Phase 5 onwards
//! MixEngine installs its own CA into that same OS trust store, so its own CA becomes trusted by its
//! own downloader. The private key for it sits on the user's machine — anybody holding it already
//! owns the machine — and it cannot touch the signature above, which is the layer that actually
//! decides authenticity.
