//! The `runtime_installs` table, and the two facts about a language that are not the index's.
//!
//! This module owns every write to that table and nothing else — the same division
//! [`crate::jobs`] draws over the work a job does: what downloads eighty megabytes is
//! [`crate::install`], what decides to is the daemon, and what is written down afterwards is here.
//!
//! # A row exists only for a directory that does
//!
//! The order every caller follows is: install into place, *then* write the row; remove the
//! directory, *then* delete the row. Neither half is a transaction across the two, because there is
//! no such thing — SQLite cannot roll back a rename. What the ordering buys is that the failure
//! modes are the survivable ones: a directory with no row is invisible and costs disk, a row with no
//! directory is a runtime that fails the moment somebody uses it. The first is a repair, the second
//! is a bug report.
//!
//! # Two facts that belong to the language rather than to the index
//!
//! [`directory`] and [`smoke_test`]. Where a version lands is MixEngine's layout and not the
//! publisher's, and which flag prints a version is a fact about PHP and Node — which is exactly why
//! [`install::SmokeTest`](crate::install::SmokeTest) arrives as an argument rather than being
//! decided down there. Everything else about an artifact comes out of the signed index.
