//! What an installed build can load, what it does load, and the file that says so — roadmap task
//! **T28**.
//!
//! Three facts meet here. Two are the artifact's, written down at install time by
//! [`super::remember`]: which of its extensions are linked in, and which are files it could load.
//! The third is the user's, and it is stored as a **deviation** — `{"xdebug": true}` — so that a
//! reinstall or a patch upgrade brings the new build's defaults with it and keeps only what somebody
//! deliberately turned round.
//!
//! # It is not a `match` on the kind
//!
//! Everything here keys off the artifact declaring an extension directory. A Node install declares
//! none, so its state is empty, it renders no documents, and it gets no directory under `etc/`. The
//! day a runtime that is not PHP publishes loadable modules, this needs no edit.
