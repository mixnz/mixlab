//!
//! **The row is the truth; the file is a rendering** — the T77 design, D7. `blueprints.manifest_toml`
//! is the blueprint. `blueprints/<slug>.toml` exists so a person can read and copy it, and is never
//! parsed back into state — the rule everything under `etc/` has lived by since the beginning.
//!
//! # The name is validated because it becomes a filename
//!
//! [`validated_slug`] is a security boundary and not a nicety: the slug is joined onto
//! [`crate::Paths::blueprints`], so `../../etc/x` would write outside the home. The refusal is what
//! makes the join safe, rather than anything the join itself does.
