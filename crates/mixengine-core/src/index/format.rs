//! The packages an index describes, as every encoding of it decodes to.
//!
//! [`schema1`](super::schema1) reads them straight out of `index.json`, and
//! [`schema2`](super::schema2) puts them back together from a kind file — the same values either
//! way. What follows is the history of their shape, and it still holds.
//!
//! Written against the document at
//! <https://github.com/mixnz/mixengine-packages/releases/download/index/index.json> rather
//! than against the sketch that preceded it, which is the whole reason T20a was ordered first. The
//! two differ in exactly the places a client trips over: `provides` is a map from executable name to
//! its path inside the archive rather than a list of names, because the daemon needs to know *where*
//! a binary is and a borrowed archive keeps its publisher's layout; and `requires` hangs off the
//! artifact rather than the package, because a Windows PHP needs a VC++ redistributable and the same
//! version on Linux needs a glibc, and neither statement is true of the other.
//!
//! Everything here is `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`-free on purpose, which is the opposite of the
//! rule `config.toml` follows. That file is written by a user, where a typo silently ignored is a
//! setting they believe is in effect. This one is written by us and read by builds older than it:
//! an index that adds a field must stay readable by every client already deployed, or adding one
//! becomes a breaking change and the `schema` number has to move for things that break nothing.
