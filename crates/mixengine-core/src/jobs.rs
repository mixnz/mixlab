//! The `jobs` table: what the daemon has been asked to do that is too long to answer inline.
//!
//! This module owns every write to that table and nothing else. What it does *not* own is the work:
//! a job here is a row and a state machine, and the thing that downloads eighty megabytes is the
//! daemon's — the same division [`crate::services`] draws, where this crate persists a transition
//! and the supervisor is what causes one.
//!
//! **Persisted and emitted are one value**, exactly as at T14: [`progress`] and [`finish`] return
//! the [`JobProgress`] and [`JobFinish`] they wrote, and the daemon publishes *those* as
//! [`DaemonEvent::JobProgress`](mixengine_proto::DaemonEvent::JobProgress) and
//! [`JobFinished`](mixengine_proto::DaemonEvent::JobFinished). A move that did not survive its
//! transaction cannot be announced.
//!
//! **There is no `delete`, and no trimming.** `jobs` is the one table in this schema that grows with
//! use, and a home that installs a runtime a week accumulates rows for years. Bounding it is
//! [`JobFilter::limit`](mixengine_proto::JobFilter) — a bound on what is *read* — because deleting
//! history is a decision with a policy behind it (how long, whose, what a support conversation still
//! needs), and inventing that policy here, before anything has produced a single job, would be
//! guessing at it. The `events` table beside it has the same shape and the same answer.
