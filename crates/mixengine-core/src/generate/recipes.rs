//! The services this build knows how to run.
//!
//! One module per `packages.name`, each one a [`Recipe`](super::Recipe) and each one its own roadmap
//! task: Caddy is T31, php-fpm T32, MariaDB T33, PostgreSQL T34, Redis and Memcached both T35,
//! MySQL T34c, Nginx T37 and MongoDB T154. The machinery they are plugged into — the merge, the render, the diff,
//! the staging, the validation — is T30's and lives one directory up; what a module in here owns is
//! a template, the overrides worth having, and the [`ServiceSpec`] that runs the program.
//!
//! **Two of them are for the same job, and only one of them may be doing it.** [`caddy`] and
//! [`nginx`] are the two programs a site can be reached through, and
//! [`Role::FrontEnd`](super::Role) is how they say so — a rule about a *job*, which
//! [`Instancing`](super::Instancing) cannot express because it is about a package. Everything else
//! about the pair is a difference in how one server answers what the other answers differently, and
//! `crates/mixengine-cli/tests/harness/frontend.rs` is the sequence both have to walk.
//!
//! **One of them renders nothing at all.** Memcached has no configuration file format — every
//! setting is a command-line flag — so its overrides land in the spec's arguments and it is the one
//! service with no `etc/<service-id>/` directory. See [`memcached`].
//!
//! **Two of them are the same programs under different names, and are not the same product.**
//! [`mariadb`] and [`mysql`] both publish a `mysqld`-shaped server, a `my.cnf` and a client that
//! reads `MYSQL_PWD`, and everything a person maintains against one of them — the bootstrap, the
//! grant tables, which accounts exist afterwards — differs. They are two recipes and two packages,
//! and the one thing they share is the port they would both like: 3306, which is why an allocation
//! happens when a row is written rather than at start ([`crate::services::ports`]).
//!
//! **One of them has to create something before it can run.** A database is a rendered file, a
//! command line, *and* a data directory that a different program makes once, with a credential that
//! must exist nowhere on disk — see [`Recipe::ritual`](super::Recipe::ritual) and
//! [`first_run`](super::first_run). **Two of them do**: MariaDB is the first and PostgreSQL the
//! second, and everything either of them needs is on the trait rather than inside one module.
//!
//! **One of them does not come out of a package.** php-fpm's process lives inside a PHP that
//! `runtime.install` put in `runtime_installs`, which is what [`Recipe::source`](super::Source) is
//! for — see [`php_fpm`].
//!
//! **Compiled in, not published.** The reasoning is [`super::recipe`]'s and is worth repeating only
//! as the consequence it has for this directory: a template that changes with a MixEngine release
//! belongs in a MixEngine release. The package index describes a *download*.
//!
