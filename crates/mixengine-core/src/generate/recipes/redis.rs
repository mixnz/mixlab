//! Redis — roadmap task **T35**, with [`memcached`](super::memcached) the other half of it.
//!
//! The simplest recipe in the catalogue, and it is worth saying what makes it simple: there is
//! nothing to create before it runs. No data directory a second program has to build, no credential
//! that must exist in the OS keyring before anything touches the disk — a rendered file, a command
//! line, and a server. What T33 and T34 needed [`Recipe::ritual`] for, this one does not need
//! at all.
//!
//! # The one constraint, and it is upstream's
//!
//! `getAbsolutePath()` in Redis's `server.c` decides a path is absolute with
//! `if (relpath[0] == '/')` and otherwise joins it to `getcwd()`. **No Windows spelling of the
//! configuration path survives being passed as an argument** — both `C:\…` and `C:/…` arrive glued
//! onto the working directory. So the file is named *relatively* beside a working directory of its
//! own, which is one rule holding on all five published cells rather than a Windows arm here. That
//! was measured in `mixengine-packages` against every one of those cells and handed over as a
//! constraint on this side; a `/cygdrive/c/…` path would also have worked and is refused, because it
//! would put an emulation layer's private spelling into a command line MixEngine builds.
//!
//! # A cache, and it says so in every direction
//!
//! `save ""` and `appendonly no` mean this instance never writes its dataset anywhere, and the stop
//! is `SHUTDOWN NOSAVE` so that it does not start writing one on the way out either. That is a
//! decision rather than an omission: `docs/features/services.md` says appendonly off by default
//! for development, and a cache that half-persists is the arrangement where somebody comes to trust
//! data that will disappear the next time the process is recycled.
//!
//! # What this recipe deliberately does not do
//!
//! **It offers no reload.** `CONFIG SET` changes a running server without touching the file, which
//! is the opposite of what a reload has to mean where the file is rendered from the database — the
//! row would be behind the server within one command. A changed configuration is a restart, which
//! is what [`ReloadBehaviour`](mixengine_proto::ReloadBehaviour)'s own documentation already says
//! about this service.
//!
//! **It listens on no Unix socket.** One address is one thing for T38 to diagnose and one thing for
//! a project's `.env` to name, and the socket would buy a local round trip that is loopback already.
