//! Which version of a language a directory uses — the one answer every "which PHP is this?" has
//! been deferring to.
//!
//! One function, [`runtime`], used by the shims, the daemon, the CLI and the GUI alike, because two
//! implementations of this would be two answers to a question that has exactly one. The order is
//! [runtime-versions.md](../../../docs/features/runtime-versions.md)'s, and each step is here
//! rather than in a client for the reason `CLAUDE.md` gives: a GUI that resolved differently from a
//! shim would make `php -v` in a terminal disagree with the version the window says it is using.
//!
//! ```text
//! 1  a flag, or MIXENGINE_PHP           read by the process the user invoked, passed in
//! 2  mixengine.toml                     walking up from the directory
//! 3  a project registered in this home  the nearest registered root at or above it
//! 4  the kind's default version         what `mix runtime default` set
//! ```
//!
//! # What a constraint is matched against
//!
//! **The installed versions, and never the downloadable ones.** The feature spec says so, and the
//! reason is worth keeping in view: the alternative is a `cd` into a directory quietly starting an
//! eighty-megabyte download. A constraint nothing installed satisfies is
//! [`Error::RuntimeUnresolved`], whose message names the install command that would fix it.
//!
//! Which of several matches wins is
//! [`PackageVersion::cmp_precedence`](mixengine_proto::PackageVersion::cmp_precedence) — the newest, as upstream
//! means "newest" rather than as ASCII does.
//!
//! # One of the four sources reads something that is often not there
//!
//! A `mixengine.toml` is optional, and most directories have none. A project record is the other
//! half of the same walk and **is** reachable now: T39 gave this build `project.*`, so step 3 stops
//! being a step nothing has ever taken. Both are walked to the top before the next one starts,
//! which is the order the feature spec lists and not the same thing as one walk asking both
//! questions per directory.
