//! Routing a managed TLD to a nameserver of our own, against the real machine.
//!
//! The unwritten half of this file is the important one. **Every test that concludes something from
//! a name that did *not* resolve first proves, with the same instrument and at the same moment,
//! that the instrument is alive** — the T45 design, D14.
//!
//! That rule is not a style preference. The measurement this whole task was designed from ran six
//! rounds and **four of them were void**: a fake DNS server was started in one CI step and asked
//! from the next, the runner killed it with the step, and every "Windows routes nothing" result was
//! a statement about a dead socket. Nothing noticed until a control was added. A test that says "the
//! name did not resolve" without one is making a claim about itself.
//!
//! And on Windows the instrument must be `getaddrinfo` — [`std::net::ToSocketAddrs`] — and never
//! `nslookup`, which was measured to bypass the Name Resolution Policy Table entirely and would
//! report a correctly wired machine as broken.
