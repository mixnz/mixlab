//! Linux: `certutil`, and the databases Firefox and Chrome read instead of the system store.
//!
//! **The tool is not installed on a stock Ubuntu 24.04** — the T49b design, D7, and the measurement
//! that task started from. It ships in `libnss3-tools`, which `libnss3` does not pull in. A machine
//! without it is a state to report, and the report names the package.
//!
//! **Every invocation gets a null stdin and a deadline** — D8, which is T49a's macOS lesson applied
//! before it cost anything here. `security remove-trusted-cert` once waited twenty minutes in CI
//! printing nothing, because `Command::output()` inherits stdin and has no timeout; `certutil` has
//! the same failure available to it, since a Firefox profile with a master password set makes it
//! prompt. A daemon start that inherited stdin would never finish.
//!
//! **One database's failure never fails the survey.** Each is independent, and a locked or broken
//! profile is a line in the report rather than an error return.
