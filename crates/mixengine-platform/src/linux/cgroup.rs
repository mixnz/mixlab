//! The cgroup v2 a supervised service is capped in, and the subtree it is allowed to live in.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T68**. Three facts shape every line here, and none of them is true on the other
//! two systems:
//!
//! 1. **An unprivileged process may only write the cgroups delegated to it.** systemd's user manager
//!    delegates a subtree to `user@N.service`; a machine with no systemd delegates nothing. Both are
//!    ordinary machines and neither may be assumed, so the boundary is **discovered** —
//!    [`Delegation::discover`] — and never built from a path this code knows the shape of.
//! 2. **Delegation is per controller.** `memory` and `pids` arrive far more readily than `cpu`, and
//!    which of them arrive has moved between systemd releases. So a machine that caps memory and
//!    cannot cap CPU is ordinary too, and [`Delegation::controllers`] answers about each separately.
//! 3. **A process joins a cgroup by writing into it, and the process that writes may be the process
//!    itself.** Writing `0` to `cgroup.procs` means "whoever is writing", which is what lets the
//!    child put itself in between `fork` and `exec` — see [`Cgroup::procs_fd`] — instead of being
//!    put in by the daemon after it is already running and possibly already forking.
//!
//! Everything that can fail here fails into a *sentence*, not an error: a machine that will not lend
//! the mechanism still runs the service, uncapped, and says why. The T68 design, D6.
