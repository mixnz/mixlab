//! A systemd **user** unit, wanted by `default.target`.
//!
//! **The unit file is not the registration; the symlink is.** A unit in `~/.config/systemd/user/`
//! starts nothing until something wants it, and what creates the `default.target.wants` link is
//! `systemctl --user enable`. That link could be written by hand — `WantedBy=default.target` fully
//! determines its path — but `systemctl` is the authority on what an `[Install]` section means, and
//! re-deriving that here would be a second implementation of it. So this leg runs a tool where
//! `macos/autostart.rs` runs none: on that system writing the file *is* the registration, and here
//! it is not.
//!
//! **A machine with no user manager is an answer and not a failure**, on
//! [`ResolverMethod::None`](crate::ResolverMethod)'s precedent: a container, a stripped image and a
//! CI runner all have one, and what a person can act on there is a sentence naming the command to
//! run by hand.
//!
//! **`loginctl enable-linger` is deliberately not called.** Without it a systemd user manager stops
//! at logout, which is exactly the lifetime `docs/architecture/overview.md` states for the
//! daemon: *login → logout*.
//!
//! `Restart=on-failure` and **not** `Restart=always`: `mix daemon stop` must stay stopped. macOS
//! says the same with `KeepAlive: { SuccessfulExit: false }` and Windows with `<RestartOnFailure>`.
