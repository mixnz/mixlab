//! Whether a `keyring` failure means this machine has no credential store at all.
//!
//! **The one reading in this crate that is per-OS while its capability is not.** `crate::secrets`
//! is deliberately a single implementation, because the `keyring` crate is already the abstraction;
//! what is *not* shared is how each backend encodes "there is nothing here to talk to". Windows and
//! macOS say it in `keyring`'s own vocabulary. Linux does not say it at all, and this module is why
//! that costs a file.
//!
//! `keyring`'s secret-service backend maps `Locked`, `NoResult` and `Prompt` to `NoStorageAccess`
//! and **everything else** to `PlatformFailure` — so a session with no provider arrives as a
//! platform failure, and a keyring that is merely locked arrives as a machine with no store.
//! Both directions are wrong, and both are fixed here by ignoring `keyring`'s judgement on this
//! system and reading the D-Bus error *name* underneath it instead.
//!
//! **The name and not the message.** `dbus::Error`'s `Display` prints only the message, and the
//! message is the bus implementation's own wording: Ubuntu 24.04 answers an unreachable bus with
//! "Using X11 for dbus-daemon autolaunch was disabled at compile time" where the string everybody
//! quotes is "without a $DISPLAY for X11", and `dbus-broker` need not agree with `dbus-daemon`
//! about any of it. The names below are in the D-Bus specification, which is what makes them worth
//! matching. Reaching them is the whole reason this crate depends on `keyring`'s backend directly,
//! which `docs/decisions/0013-reading-the-d-bus-error-name-to-tell-an-absent-store.md` argues.
//!
//! Every name here was measured rather than looked up, on a real machine, one environment each.
