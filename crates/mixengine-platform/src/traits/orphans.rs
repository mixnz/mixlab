//! What survives a daemon that was killed — roadmap task **T47a**, reporting what **T13** built.
//!
//! [ADR 0007](../../../../docs/decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md) settled
//! that this promise is **not the same on the three systems**, and the ADR exists to stop Windows'
//! promise being repeated where it is not true. `mix doctor` states it rather than assuming it.
//!
//! **Not a trait, and not on [`Host`](crate::Host).** It is a constant per system: a trait object
//! would suggest one machine could answer differently from another machine of the same kind, and
//! nothing about it is read off the machine at all.
