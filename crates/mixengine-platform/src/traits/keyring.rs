/// `docs/decisions/0006-servicespec-in-proto-and-secret-free.md` is what makes this a capability
/// rather than a convenience: a `ServiceSpec` can *name* a credential and cannot carry one, so the
/// value has to come from somewhere at the moment a child is built, and that somewhere is the
/// Credential Manager, the login Keychain or the session's secret service. MariaDB's generated root
/// password is the first user; extension tokens follow.
///
/// The pair `(service, key)` is the whole address of a credential and is exactly what
/// `mixengine_proto::EnvValue::Keyring` carries — one naming scheme, so a spec that resolves on one
/// OS resolves on all of them. `service` is the application-side namespace (`"mixengine"`,
/// `"mixengine.mariadb@main"`), `key` the account within it.
///
/// **Nothing here logs, formats or returns a credential by accident.** A failure names the entry and
/// never the value, which is why the error variants take `service` and `key` and no message from the
/// value's side.
///
/// # Blocking
///
/// Every method blocks, and on Linux it blocks on a D-Bus round trip to a daemon that may be
/// prompting the user to unlock their keyring. A caller inside the async runtime goes through
/// `spawn_blocking`, as `docs/standards/rust.md` requires of anything that can hang.
