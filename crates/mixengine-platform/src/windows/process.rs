//! `DETACHED_PROCESS`, a process group of the child's own, and no inherited handles.
//!
//! A console is inherited on Windows, not merely written to: a child started from a terminal joins
//! that terminal's console, keeps it alive, and receives every control event sent to it.
//! `DETACHED_PROCESS` is the flag that says do none of that — the child gets no console, so closing
//! the window it was started from cannot reach it and it has nothing to print into.
//!
//! `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` on top of it is about `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent`, which addresses a
//! process *group*: without it, a Ctrl-Break aimed at the group the parent belongs to would still be
//! delivered to a child that has no console of its own.
//!
//! The consequence is deliberate and is written down in `windows/signal.rs`: a daemon started this
//! way can never receive a console control event, because there is no console to send it one.
//!
//! **The third thing is the one that had to be found rather than designed.** `CreateProcessW` is
//! called by the standard library with `bInheritHandles = TRUE`, which it needs for the child's
//! stdio, and *inheritable* is a property that survives inheritance: a handle this process was
//! itself handed by its parent arrives still marked inheritable and is passed on again. So a
//! `mixengined --detach` started with its stdout on a pipe — which is exactly what a client
//! autostarting a daemon does, and what `std::process::Command::output` does — gave the daemon a
//! copy of that pipe. Redirecting the child's own stdio to the null device does not help: the extra
//! copy is not the child's stdout, it is simply a handle the child holds, and the writing end of a
//! pipe stays open while anybody holds one. The caller reading that pipe then waits for an
//! end-of-file that arrives when the daemon exits, days later. Reproduced before this was written,
//! as a `--detach` that returned promptly and a parent that never did.
//!
//! Clearing that flag is the only way to say it — `bInheritHandles` is per `CreateProcessW` and the
//! flag is per handle, so there is no third place to put "this one child gets nothing". What can be
//! narrowed is *how long* it is said for: the flag is put back as soon as the spawn returns, so a
//! caller that goes on to start other children — `mix`, the GUI at roadmap task T10 — passes its
//! stdio on to them exactly as it would have. The window that remains is the spawn itself, and it is
//! the same window `bInheritHandles` already makes process-wide for every concurrent `CreateProcessW`
//! in the program; this makes it no wider.
//!
//! # The other half: a child that must *not* outlive us
//!
//! Everything above is about letting go of a process. [`group`] is the opposite request, and on this
//! system it is the easy one: a Job Object with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` takes its whole
//! membership down when the last handle to it closes, which a killed daemon does exactly as reliably
//! as an exiting one. No code of ours runs, and grandchildren are covered — neither of which is true
//! of the Unix side, and
//! `docs/decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md` is where that difference is
//! written down rather than averaged out.
