//! A named pipe this account owns and alone may open, with each end checking who the other is.
//!
//! Windows has no equivalent of a socket file sitting inside a directory we already locked down, so
//! both halves of the protection have to be stated explicitly here.
//!
//! **The name carries the home.** The pipe namespace is flat and machine-wide, so
//! `\\.\pipe\mixengine` alone would be one endpoint per machine: a sandbox daemon started with
//! `MIXENGINE_HOME` pointing somewhere disposable would collide with the real install, and two
//! tests would collide with each other. The name is therefore
//! `\\.\pipe\mixengine.<sid>.<fingerprint of run/>` — the SID because a second account signing in
//! runs its own daemon, and the fingerprint because one account can have several homes. This is a
//! correction to `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md`, which described the SID alone.
//!
//! **The first instance is claimed, not joined.** `FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE` is what makes
//! [`Listener::bind`] refuse a name somebody else already created, rather than quietly adding an
//! instance to *their* pipe and serving whoever they attract. Every later instance must not carry
//! the flag, or it would refuse the pipe we ourselves are holding.
//!
//! **And the client asks who it reached.** Refusing to join somebody else's pipe keeps this daemon
//! from serving strangers; it does nothing for a `mix` that dials one. The name is derivable — the
//! SID is public and [`fingerprint`] is written out just above — the namespace is flat, and
//! `CreateNamedPipeW` needs no privilege, so another account can hold the name before the daemon
//! comes up and be handed every request, `elevation.*` included. So [`dial`] reads the owner of the
//! pipe object it opened and hangs up on one this account does not own, before the first byte. It
//! is the mirror of the peer check in [`Listener::accept`] and the reason [`create`] states the
//! owner rather than letting the token supply one.
