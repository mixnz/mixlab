//! Windows: one Name Resolution Policy rule, read and written as registry values.
//!
//! **Never `Add-DnsClientNrptRule`** — the T45 design, D11. `mixengine-elevate` never runs
//! arbitrary commands, and a fixed cmdlet with validated arguments is still a scripting host
//! started by a process holding an administrative token. What makes the alternative available is
//! the measurement: a rule written to exactly the values in [`crate::resolver::nrpt`] **is read
//! back by `Get-DnsClientNrptRule`**, so what MixEngine writes is what Windows' own tooling sees
//! and what a user can remove without MixEngine's help.
//!
//! The read half needs no privilege: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet` is readable by
//! any account, which is what lets the daemon ask on every start.
