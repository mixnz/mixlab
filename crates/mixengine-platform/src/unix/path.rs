//! A tagged block in the shell profiles this user's login shells read.
//!
//! There is no such thing as "the environment" on Unix: a variable a new terminal inherits comes
//! from a file some shell sourced, and which file that is depends on the shell. So this writes one
//! block, between markers, into every profile the OS in question actually reads — `linux/` and
//! `macos/` each name their own list, because the two disagree about which those are and about
//! which one to create when a home has none.
//!
//! # Why a block and not a line
//!
//! `docs/architecture/platform-abstraction.md`'s first rule: every mutation is reversible and
//! tagged. Nothing outside [`BEGIN`]…[`END`] is ever read, moved or rewritten, which is what makes
//! `remove` able to promise that a profile somebody has been editing since 2011 comes back exactly
//! as it was. The block is also *replaced* rather than added to, so a home that moved leaves one
//! block naming the new directory rather than two naming both.
//!
//! # Why the guard inside it
//!
//! `~/.profile` is read once per login and `~/.bash_profile` once per login shell — but a login
//! shell inside a login shell is an ordinary thing (`bash -l` in a multiplexer, `ssh` into your own
//! machine), and an unguarded `PATH="$dir:$PATH"` grows the variable every time. The `case` is
//! POSIX, understood by `sh`, `dash`, `bash` and `zsh` alike, and the quoting inside its pattern is
//! what makes a directory containing `*` or `[` match itself rather than something else: in a
//! `case` pattern, a quoted stretch is matched literally.
//!
//! **`fish` and `nushell` are not covered**, deliberately rather than by oversight: neither reads a
//! POSIX profile, and a `config.fish` written in fish's own syntax is a second dialect to keep
//! correct for a shell the block would have to be rewritten in. `state` names the files it wrote,
//! so a fish user can see that theirs is not among them.
