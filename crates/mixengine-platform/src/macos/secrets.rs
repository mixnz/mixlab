//! Whether a `keyring` failure means this machine has no credential store at all.
//!
//! **The short answer on this system, and the reason `linux/secrets.rs` is long.** `keyring`'s
//! Keychain backend spends `NoStorageAccess` on exactly the four `Security.framework` codes that
//! mean there is no keychain to open — `errSecNotAvailable`, `errSecReadOnly`, `errSecNoSuchKeychain`
//! and `errSecInvalidKeychain` — so its own vocabulary already says what this module has to answer,
//! and nothing has to be read out of a boxed source.
//!
//! A login Keychain is part of a macOS account, so the absent case is a machine used in a way macOS
//! does not really offer: a `launchd` daemon in the system context, or an SSH login into an account
//! that has never been logged into at the console.
