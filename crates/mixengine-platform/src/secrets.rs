//! The credential store, on whichever of the three systems this is.
//!
//! **The one capability with a single implementation instead of three.** Everything else in this
//! crate is a per-OS directory, or `unix/` where two of the three agree; this is a level below that,
//! because the `keyring` crate `docs/standards/rust.md` names *is* the abstraction — one API over
//! the Windows Credential Manager, the macOS Keychain and a Linux secret service. Writing three
//! wrappers around one library would produce three copies of the same eleven lines and three places
//! for the error mapping to drift.
//!
//! What each OS actually stores into is chosen by a feature in `Cargo.toml` rather than by code
//! here, and the choices are worth knowing:
//!
//! - **Windows** `windows-native` — the Credential Manager, per-user, unlocked with the session.
//! - **macOS** `apple-native` — the login Keychain, which may prompt the first time this binary asks
//!   for an entry it wrote, and again after the binary is replaced by an update.
//! - **Linux** `sync-secret-service` — the D-Bus secret service (`gnome-keyring`, `kwallet`), with
//!   `crypto-rust` so the session is encrypted without an OpenSSL build, and `vendored` so libdbus
//!   is compiled in rather than demanded from the machine that builds the release.
//!
//! The synchronous secret-service backend is deliberate: its async sibling blocks on an executor of
//! its own inside a synchronous call, which panics when that call is made from a runtime worker
//! thread — and every caller here is a daemon that has one. Blocking is the honest shape, and the
//! caller wraps it in `spawn_blocking` where the trait says to.
//!
//! **One thing here is per-OS after all, and it is not the implementation.** Asking *this machine
//! has no store at all* is a question `keyring` answers differently on each of the three: its own
//! `NoStorageAccess` is exactly right on Windows and macOS, and on Linux it names a keyring that is
//! locked while a session with no secret service arrives as a plain platform failure. So the reading
//! lives in `sys::secrets` — three small modules over one `Secrets`, which is the opposite split
//! from three wrappers over one library and is the only one the backends justify.
