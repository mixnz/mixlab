//! Starting a process, and deciding whether it may outlive the one that started it.
//!
//! Two opposite requests live here, and the pair is the whole of the module:
//!
//! - [`spawn_detached`] starts a process this one is letting go of. `mixengined --detach` and a
//!   client's autostart (roadmap task T10) are made of it.
//! - [`spawn_supervised`] starts a process this one owns and intends to outlive. Every managed
//!   service is made of it (roadmap task T13).
//!
//! A third relationship arrives with crash recovery and starts no process at all: [`Adopted`] is one
//! that survived the daemon which started it, taken over by the daemon running now on the strength
//! of its pid *and* its [`StartTime`] (roadmap task T18). It is the weakest of the three — liveness
//! and a stop, and nothing else — and its documentation says where that is paid for.
//!
//! [`hand_over`] is the fourth relationship and the strangest: a process that stops being itself.
//! The shim (roadmap task T25) resolves which PHP a directory uses and then has to *become* it —
//! same arguments, same streams, same terminal, same exit code. On Unix that is `exec` and there is
//! nothing left to describe; on Windows there is no such call, so it is a child in a Job Object with
//! the console events swallowed on the way past. See the function for what that costs.
//!
//! [`run_once`] is the fifth and the odd one out: a program run **to completion**, for its exit
//! status rather than for its running. `mariadb-admin ping` and `caddy stop` are what it is for
//! (roadmap task T15a) — a probe and a shutdown, both of which start a process the caller has no
//! interest in supervising. It is here rather than in the supervisor for the reason every spawn is:
//! a `Command` on Windows has to be told not to be given a console window, and that is a `#[cfg]` no
//! crate above this one is allowed to contain.
//!
//! **The difference is stated in the destructors, because that is where a reader will meet it**:
//! dropping a [`Detached`] deliberately does not stop the child, and dropping a [`Supervised`]
//! deliberately does.
//!
//! Detaching is the part every OS does differently. Surviving the parent is the easy half and comes
//! for free on both systems; what has to be arranged is that the child stops being *attached* to
//! whoever started it:
//!
//! - it must not be reached by a Ctrl-C meant for the terminal the parent was typed into,
//! - it must not write into that terminal hours later, and
//! - it must not keep the terminal's console alive on Windows.
//!
//! The stdio redirection is the one piece that is genuinely shared, so it is done here: all three
//! streams go to the null device. A daemon that has detached says everything it has to say in
//! `logs/daemon.log`, and inheriting the parent's handles is how a background process ends up
//! printing into a shell prompt somebody is using.
//!
//! Supervising is the part every OS does differently *and* does with different force. A supervised
//! child leads a process group of its own — a Job Object on Windows, a session on Unix — so that
//! stopping it means stopping everything it started, and so that a daemon which goes away takes it
//! along. How completely that last part is true depends on the system and is set out in
//! `docs/decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md`: a kernel guarantee on Windows,
//! a guard that covers the immediate child on Linux, and nothing at all on macOS, where crash
//! recovery at the next boot (roadmap task T18) is what closes the gap.
