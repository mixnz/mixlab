//! `security.capability`, the extended attribute a Linux file carries its capabilities in.
//!
//! **No `libcap`.** `getcap` and `setcap` come from a package that is not guaranteed present, and
//! the read side runs on every daemon start on every Linux machine, so it may not depend on one
//! being installed — the T42 design, D8. Once `getxattr` is being called, `setxattr` is the same
//! quantity of `unsafe` for the write side, so both directions are syscalls and the format is
//! decoded here.
//!
//! **Compiled on all three systems** so the codec is tested on all three, exactly as the elevation
//! launchers' tables are: this is a byte layout with nothing OS-specific in it beyond the kernel
//! that reads it. The two syscalls are in `linux/port_access.rs`.
//!
//! The layout is `struct vfs_cap_data` from `linux/capability.h`: a little-endian `magic_etc`, then
//! a `permitted` and an `inheritable` mask for each of the two 32-bit halves of the capability set.
//! Revision 1 stops after the first half (12 bytes), revision 2 carries both (20), and revision 3
//! appends a `rootid` (24) without moving anything before it.
