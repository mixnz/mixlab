//! Wire types shared by `mixengined` and every client.
//!
//! This crate is the single source of truth for the API surface: requests, responses, events and
//! the wire error. It is `serde`-only on purpose — no I/O, no platform code, no domain logic — so
//! that a client can depend on it without pulling in the daemon's world, and so that the published
//! TypeScript contract can be generated from it — `bindings/` at the repository root, roadmap task
//! **T56**, behind this crate's `ts` feature and off in every shipped binary.
//!
//! The payload types are re-exported flat, because a caller writes `DaemonStatus` and never wants
//! to say which module it came from. [`rpc`] stays a module: `rpc::Request` is a JSON-RPC request
//! and not a MixEngine one, and the qualification is what keeps that visible at every call site.

/// method's contract changed: the things an older peer cannot survive however carefully it was
/// written.
