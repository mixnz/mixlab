//! What `runtime.*` asks and answers, where [`crate::runtime`] is the vocabulary a runtime is
//! *described* in.
//!
//! **The `Extension*` types here are PHP extensions**, switched on for one installed runtime.
//! MixEngine's own extensions — Mailpit, phpMyAdmin, Adminer — are [`crate::extension`], and the two
//! vocabularies never meet.
//!
//! The same split [`crate::job_api`] draws over [`crate::job`]. Four of the seven methods take
//! [`RuntimeTarget`] — install, uninstall, set_default and list_extensions all name one version of
//! one kind, and
//! writing that question three times would be three places for it to drift, which is
//! [`JobQuery`](crate::JobQuery)'s reasoning one namespace across.
//!
//! **[`RuntimeQuestion`] is deliberately not a fourth user of it.** `runtime.resolve` is the one
//! method that is *asking* which version rather than naming one, so what it takes is a constraint
//! and a directory — and what it answers carries the reason as well as the answer.
//!
//! **`runtime.install` answers a [`JobSummary`](crate::JobSummary) and not a runtime.** An install
//! is tens of megabytes over somebody's connection, and
//! `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md` says a long operation returns a job rather than holding
//! a call open. What the finished job carries as its result is a [`RuntimeSummary`] — the same
//! sentence `runtime.list_installed` answers with, so a client renders the ending of an install with
//! the function it already has.
