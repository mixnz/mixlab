//! What `daemon.uninstall_plan` and `daemon.uninstall` answer — roadmap task **T87**.
//!
//! **A list of things that can be there, and not a list of things that were.** A report that
//! printed only what it removed would leave a person unable to tell *"there was no resolver
//! wiring"* from *"the resolver wiring was not looked at"* — which on the one command whose whole
//! promise is that nothing is left behind is the difference between an answer and a shrug. So every
//! row appears, whatever it answered, exactly as [`DoctorReport`](crate::DoctorReport) does and for
//! its reason.
//!
//! **It is a measurement and not a claim.** `daemon.uninstall` reads the machine again after the
//! grant and sets each [`Removal`] from what it finds; the helper is honest about what it did, but
//! it is a separate process describing finished work (the T87 design, D3).
//!
//! **[`Removal`] and not `Disposition`**, which is the word this document reached for first: this
//! crate already exports a `Disposition` — a blueprint's — and a flat re-export has room for one.
