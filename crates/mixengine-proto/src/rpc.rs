//! The JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope every call travels in.
//!
//! The spec is followed rather than approximated, because the reason
//! `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md` chose HTTP in the first place was off-the-shelf clients:
//! a `jsonrpc` member on both sides, an integer `error.code`, `id` echoed back on every response and
//! omitted only by a notification, batches as arrays.
//!
//! **Two error codes, and they are not competing.** JSON-RPC insists `error.code` is an integer, and
//! its useful values are the five reserved ones — a client library can tell "you sent nonsense" from
//! "the server broke" without knowing anything about MixEngine. That is all it can tell, which is
//! why every error also carries [`ErrorData`] with the [`ErrorCode`] from
//! [`crate::Error`]: the integer is for generic tooling, the string is what `mix` and the GUI
//! actually branch on. The message is written once, in the standard `message` member, and not
//! repeated inside `data`.
