//! The file protocol between `mixengined` and `mixengine-elevate`.
//!
//! The daemon writes a [`PrivilegedRequest`] into a fresh single-use directory, raises the OS
//! elevation prompt on the helper with that file's path as its one argument, and reads the
//! [`PrivilegedResponse`] the helper leaves beside it. See
//! `docs/decisions/0005-on-demand-elevation.md` and the T40 design for why it is files and not a
//! socket: the helper has no listener, no idle state, and exists for seconds.
//!
//! **The response file is the protocol.** When it is there, it is the answer and the exit code says
//! nothing; the exit code matters only when there is no file. That is not a preference — the macOS
//! launcher raises an AppleScript error instead of handing back a status, so an outcome encoded as a
//! number is an outcome one of the three systems has to reconstruct from an error string.
//!
//! **What is denied and what is tolerated runs in opposite directions on purpose.** The request and
//! every operation in it use `deny_unknown_fields`: a helper that silently ignored a field inside an
//! operation it thought it understood would apply a weaker version of that operation and tell nobody.
//! The response does not: the helper is excluded from auto-update, so a helper newer than the daemon
//! reading it is routine, and a field it added must not make its answer unreadable.
