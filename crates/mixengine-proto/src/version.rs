//! Version strings and the constraints that select between them.
//!
//! Not runtime-specific and never was: a [`PackageVersion`] is upstream's own string, validated
//! because it becomes a path component, and `packages/<name>/<version>/` needs that as much as
//! `runtimes/<kind>/<version>/` does. The `Runtime` prefix these types carried until T31a described
//! the only caller there happened to be, not what they are about.
//!
//! # The version *grammar* lives here, and the resolution *order* does not
//!
//! T24 added [`VersionConstraint`] and [`PackageVersion::cmp_precedence`] beside the identifier they
//! are about. They are here rather than in `mixengine_core::resolve` because a constraint travels on
//! the wire — `runtime.resolve` takes one — and this crate validates what it carries, on the same
//! reasoning that made a version a validated type in the first place: `^8.3` arriving as a `String`
//! would be refused somewhere further in, with the caller's request already half honoured.
//!
//! [`Execution`] joined them at T92 on the same reasoning one step further out: it is neither a
//! version nor a constraint, but it is a property of *a published build as this machine would run
//! it*, and both [`crate::RuntimeRelease`] and [`crate::PackageRelease`] carry it. A module of its
//! own for one enum would be a fourth thing in the layout list to say one word.
//!
//! What is *not* here is which of four sources a constraint came from. That order — flag,
//! `mixengine.toml`, project record, default — reads a file and a table, which makes it domain logic
//! and `mixengine_core::resolve`'s.
