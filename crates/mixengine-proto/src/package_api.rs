//! What `package.*` asks and answers, for the servers, databases and caches a home runs.
//!
//! The same split [`crate::runtime_api`] draws over [`crate::runtime`], one namespace across: what a
//! package *is* on disk has no vocabulary of its own — a name and a [`PackageVersion`] is the whole
//! of it — so this module is the API surface and there is no `package.rs` beside it.
//!
//! # Two listings rather than one row type with a flag
//!
//! [`PackageList`] answers what is installed and [`PackageCatalogue`] answers what the index offers,
//! and they are made of different types on [`RuntimeRelease`](crate::RuntimeRelease)'s stated
//! reasoning: what is knowable about something installed and about something merely offered is
//! different, and one type carrying both would be a type where half the fields are meaningless in
//! half the answers. [`PackageRelease`] still carries [`installed`](PackageRelease::installed),
//! composed by the daemon out of the index and the `packages` rows rather than left to a client to
//! work out by cross-referencing two lists.
//!
//! # What a listing is allowed to name
//!
//! Only a package this build has a recipe for — `mixengine_core::generate::Catalogue`'s own set. An
//! index entry MixEngine cannot configure is a download that ends in a directory nothing can use,
//! and the refusal belongs at install time rather than at create time, where the disk is already
//! spent. Two MixEngine versions reading one index therefore answer differently, which is correct:
//! the answer is *what this build can run*.
//!
//! **Runtimes are not here.** They have `runtime_installs`, `runtimes/`, a default version and a
//! shim that reads it; a second door to the same room would either duplicate all of that or produce
//! a PHP the shim cannot see.
//!
//! [`PackageVersion`]: crate::PackageVersion
