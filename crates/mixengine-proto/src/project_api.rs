//! What `project.*` asks and answers: a directory this home has been told about, and the versions
//! it pins.
//!
//! The same split `package_api` draws — this module is the API surface, and there is no
//! `project.rs` beside it, because what a project *is* has no vocabulary of its own: a name, a
//! directory and a map of constraints is the whole of it.
//!
//! **The database is the source of truth and the manifest is input** (spec D1). A create writes a
//! row and does not touch the user's repository; [`ProjectExport`] is what a person asks for when
//! they want the file a colleague will read. But the manifest *outranks* the row at resolve time,
//! so a row pin the manifest contradicts can never take effect — which is why [`ProjectPin`]
//! carries where it was read from and whether anything installed satisfies it, rather than leaving
//! somebody to read `8.3` in a window while their shell runs `8.4`.
