//! What arrives on `GET /events`.
//!
//! The vocabulary in `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md` — `MetricsSample`, `CertExpiring` and
//! the rest — is declared here **one variant at a time, as the code that emits it lands**. Writing
//! them all up front would mean inventing identifier types before the code that issues them has an
//! opinion, and publishing a wire contract nothing can produce.
//! [`DaemonEvent::ServiceStateChanged`] is the first to arrive that way, with T14; the two job
//! variants are the second, with T22, and they are the case that shows why the rule is worth
//! keeping — `JobId` turned out to be the rowid of a table that did not exist when the architecture
//! document named the type.
//!
//! `LogLine` is the one variant listed there that will never be built: output travels on its own
//! endpoint, per [ADR 0009](https://github.com/mixnz/mixlab/blob/master/docs/decisions/0009-logs-travel-on-their-own-stream.md).
//!
//! What is here is the part of the stream that belongs to the stream itself, and the rule the
//! architecture states plainly: **events are best-effort and must never be the only way state is
//! learned.** A client that reconnects, or that is told to [`DaemonEvent::Resync`], calls the
//! matching `*.list` and rebuilds what it knows.
