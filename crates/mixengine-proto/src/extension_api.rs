//! `extension.inspect` — roadmap task **T80**.
//!
//! One method, and it is read-only: T80 installs nothing. What it answers is what an install on
//! this machine *would* produce, which is `blueprint.apply --dry-run`'s position — a plan is worth
//! having because it was computed rather than because it was described.
//!
//! The same split [`crate::job_api`] draws over [`crate::job`]: [`crate::extension`] is the
//! vocabulary an extension is *described* in, and this is what one call asks and answers.
