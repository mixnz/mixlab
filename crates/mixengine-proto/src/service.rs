//! What a supervised service *is* — the vocabulary `mixengine-core` writes and
//! `mixengine-supervisor` runs.
//!
//! This lives in `proto` rather than in either of those crates because they are siblings that cannot
//! depend on each other, and because a [`ServiceSpec`] is not a supervisor implementation detail: a
//! row in `services` stores it, the GUI's Services screen edits it, and an `extension.toml` declares
//! one. The reasoning, and the rule it sets for the rest of the workspace, are in
//! `docs/decisions/0006-servicespec-in-proto-and-secret-free.md`.
//!
//! The consequence worth stating twice: **a spec cannot express a secret by value.** See
//! [`EnvValue`].
//!
//! Three fields describe behaviour no code implements yet — [`ServiceSpec::limits`],
//! [`ServiceSpec::idle`] and [`ServiceSpec::logs`], enforced by roadmap tasks T68, T69 and T16. They
//! are declared now so those phases add an implementation rather than a field, and so a spec written
//! today does not have to be revisited to gain one.
