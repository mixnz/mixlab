//! A program that misbehaves on request, so supervision can be tested against something other than
//! MariaDB.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/process-supervision.md` lists what it has to be able to do — start slowly,
//! never become ready, exit with a code after N ms, ignore a request to stop, leave a child behind —
//! and `mixengine_testkit::FakeService` is the caller's side of every flag below.
//!
//! It also stands in for the *daemon* in the supervision tests, which is what `--supervise`,
//! `--child` and `--hold-lock` are for: a process that owns a supervised child, a child that owns
//! nothing, and a beacon that says from outside whether a process is really still there. Only a
//! separate process can be killed the way a daemon is killed, and the test cannot be that process.
//!
//! **No `#[cfg]` anywhere in here**, which is the interesting constraint. Ignoring a request to stop,
//! leaving a detached child behind and owning a supervised one are all things the two families of
//! operating system do differently, and all of them are reached through `mixengine-platform` — the
//! same code paths the daemon uses, which means this fixture is also a second user of them.
