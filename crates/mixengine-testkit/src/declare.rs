//! The rows a service has to have before anything can start it, and the one a killed daemon leaves.
//!
//! **Scaffolding for a build that cannot create a service yet, and nothing more.** A `services` row
//! is what `mixengine-core` transitions, what the supervisor writes a pid into and — since roadmap
//! task **T30** — what the daemon renders into a configuration and a `ServiceSpec`. What is still
//! missing is Phase 3's `service.create`, so every suite that drives a service through the daemon
//! has to put the row there itself. This is that, written once.
//!
//! [`running`] is the exception that is not scaffolding for a missing feature but for a state no
//! test can ask a daemon to produce: a daemon that is running clears those columns on its way out,
//! whichever way it is asked to stop, so the only way to hand a *new* daemon the row a killed one
//! leaves behind is to write it. Crash recovery (roadmap task **T18**) is what reads it.
//!
//! # Every row here belongs to `fakeservice`
//!
//! A daemon turns a row into something runnable by looking up a **recipe** for `packages.name`, and
//! the recipe a debug build has beyond what MixEngine ships is the one for this crate's own
//! `fakeservice` — see `crates/mixengine-daemon/src/services/fakeservice.rs`. So the row [`package`]
//! writes names that program and points at the directory it was built into, and how a service is to
//! *behave* is said in overrides through [`Service`] rather than in a spec the test writes. That is
//! what replaced `MIXENGINE_DEV_SPECS`, and it is narrower in the way that matters: a test
//! configures a service, where before it described an arbitrary program to run.
//!
//! A suite with a **real** server on disk — the Caddy CI fetches — has no business here at all any
//! more: since T31a it packs that server into an archive, serves it from a `MockRegistry` and
//! installs it through `package.install`, which is the path a user takes.
//!
//! **This is the one place in the crate that knows the schema**, which is the exception to the rule
//! [`crate`] states about restating conventions: there is no way to write a row without knowing the
//! table, and the alternative — a second copy inside every suite — is what this crate exists to
//! prevent. The queries are plain [`sqlx::query()`] rather than the checked macro, because a
//! dev-dependency has no business in `.sqlx/`, which is prepared for the crates that ship.
