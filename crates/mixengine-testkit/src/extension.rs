//! The `extension.toml` fixtures — roadmap task **T80**, made true by **T82** and **T82a**.
//!
//! **These are the manifests T82 shipped**, not examples written to fit the parser. A format proved
//! against files invented for it proves only that it is self-consistent; these are the kinds as the
//! products they describe actually need them, which is where a format finds out what it forgot —
//! and it did: T80's `[web-app].root = "{install_dir}/app"` and its `template` field were both wrong
//! about the real artifacts, which is what T82's design D1 and its roadmap line record.
//!
//! **Every one that downloads something carries the real hash**, which T80 said none ever would.
//! That rule was written when a hash here could only go stale; what changed is that these are now
//! the same bytes
//! `mixnz/mixengine-packages` publishes under `data/extensions/`, and a fixture that agreed with the
//! roster about everything except the one field somebody would copy is a trap rather than a
//! precaution. Nothing in this workspace downloads one of these, so a hash that goes stale costs a
//! diff and no red test; what proves the published roster against upstream is that repository's own
//! `check-extensions.yml`.
//!
//! `sendmail.toml` has no hash: a `recipe` downloads nothing.

/// A `service` that also carries a recipe — D7's case, in one file.
