//! *Does this URL answer, and with what?* — the one question both HTTP checks ask.
//!
//! `ReadyCheck::Http` and `HealthProbe::Http` are the same request with two different verdicts
//! around it: readiness retries until the status matches or the deadline passes, health asks once
//! and folds the answer into a run. So the request lives here and neither module owns it.
//!
//! # Two failures, and only one of them is an error
//!
//! A connection refused, a socket that closed, a server that answered with something unparseable:
//! none of those is a failure of the supervisor. They are the answer *no*, which is what a service
//! that is not up yet looks like from outside — [`Endpoint::ask`] reports them as [`None`] and the
//! caller decides whether to retry or to count a failure.
//!
//! A URL that is not a URL is the other kind, and it is the spec's fault rather than the service's.
//! It is found by [`Endpoint::parse`] **before anything waits**, on the same reasoning
//! [`crate::ready`] compiles a `LogPattern`'s regex up front: a check that can never pass should not
//! be reported as a service that never came up, or whoever reads it goes looking at the wrong thing.
//!
//! # Plaintext only, and it says so
//!
//! Every URL a MixEngine spec has any business naming is on the loopback interface — Caddy's admin
//! endpoint, php-fpm's status page, a runtime's own health route — and none of them is HTTPS. An
//! `https://` check therefore answers [`Error::UnsupportedCheck`] naming what is missing, rather
//! than pulling a TLS stack and a certificate store into the supervisor to verify a certificate for
//! `127.0.0.1`.
