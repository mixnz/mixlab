//! *Is it still fine?* — asked over and over, once a service is ready.
//!
//! The counterpart to [`crate::ready`], and deliberately a different question with a different
//! answer. A ready check asks once and then stops; this one asks forever, and what it produces is
//! not "up" or "down" but a move between `Running` and `Degraded` — a process that is alive and
//! failing is the case the GUI shows in amber and `mix doctor` explains, and it is the case a
//! restart policy must *not* treat as a crash.
//!
//! # Why a probe is not a verdict
//!
//! One failed probe is not a sick service. A database checkpointing under load misses a ping; a
//! machine that has just woken from sleep misses several. A dashboard that flickers amber teaches
//! people to ignore it, which costs more than the flicker. So a verdict needs a *run* of agreeing
//! probes — `failures_before_degraded` of them to fall, `successes_before_running` to recover — and
//! this module keeps that count.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! It does not sleep, own a task, or decide anything about the process. The caller drives it —
//! `interval`, probe, fold the result in, act on the verdict — because the thing that owns the
//! timing also owns the service's state row, the events it publishes and the cancellation token
//! that stops it. Keeping the mechanism free of the loop is what makes every rule below testable
//! without a clock.
