//! `mixengine-elevate` — the only code in MixEngine that runs with administrator privileges.
//!
//! It is started through the OS elevation prompt with **one** argument, the path to a request file;
//! it validates that request **itself** rather than trusting the daemon, applies it, writes
//! `response.json` beside it, and exits. It never listens on a socket, never runs an arbitrary
//! command, and is never resident. Keep it small enough to audit in one sitting; see
//! `docs/architecture/security-model.md` and roadmap task T40.
//!
//! **The response file is the protocol.** Exit 0 means "the batch was processed and there is a report
//! to read" — *even when every operation in it failed*. It does not mean "it worked". Every other
//! code means there is no report, and is the only case where the number itself carries the answer.
//!
//! **"User declined" is not one of these codes.** When the user clicks Cancel this binary never ran,
//! so it cannot report it; that is `ElevationOutcome::Declined`, mapped by the launcher (T40a) from
//! `ERROR_CANCELLED`, osascript's `-128` and `pkexec`'s 126.
