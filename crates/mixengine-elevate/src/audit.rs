//! The record of what ran as root.
//!
//! **Outside `MIXENGINE_HOME`**, because a root-owned file inside a directory the user owns can be
//! renamed or unlinked by that user whatever its own mode says. `%ProgramData%\MixEngine`,
//! `/Library/Logs/MixEngine`, `/var/log/mixengine` — see
//! `mixengine_platform::elevated::audit_directory`.
//!
//! **Created by the helper on first run**, not by the installer: the helper has to work on a machine
//! no installer has touched, which is exactly the machine roadmap task T41a runs it on.
//!
//! **Written only when this process is elevated.** Under an ordinary token there is no privileged
//! directory to create and nothing worth recording — every operation with effects is refused there
//! anyway, by `PrivilegedOp::requires_elevation`.
//!
//! **No rotation.** A machine produces a few dozen lines over the lifetime of an installation, and
//! rotation here is code running as root to solve a problem that does not occur.
//!
//! **And it makes what ran readable, nothing more.** It prevents nothing. It does not stand between
//! an attacker and the binary-replacement path in the threat model — a helper that has been replaced
//! is also the thing writing the log.
