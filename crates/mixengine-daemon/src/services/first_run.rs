//! Performing a first-run ritual — roadmap task **T33**.
//!
//! `mixengine-core` says *what* has to happen once ([`generate::first_run`]); this says *when*, *in
//! what order*, and *with what credentials*. It is in the daemon because both of the things it needs
//! are: the OS keyring, and the job system a long operation reports its progress through.
//!
//! # The order, and why it is that one
//!
//! 1. **Read the markers.** A directory that is already ready costs one `read_dir` and nothing else,
//!    which is what makes this affordable at the top of every start.
//! 2. **Store the credentials.** *Before* anything is created, so a machine with no credential store
//!    fails while there is nothing to clean up — rather than half-way through, leaving a data
//!    directory whose root password exists nowhere.
//! 3. **Write the started marker.** From here on, this directory is one we may clear.
//! 4. **Run the steps in order.** A step that fails ends the ritual; nothing after it runs, and the
//!    started marker is what lets the next attempt clean up rather than refuse.
//! 5. **Write the ready marker**, holding the package version that performed it.
//!
