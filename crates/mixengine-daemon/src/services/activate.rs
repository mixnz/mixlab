//! Starting a service from the connection that needed it — roadmap task **T70**.
//!
//! T69 taught the daemon to stop a service nothing was using and shipped it switched off, because
//! stopping a pool is only safe once something starts it again. This is that something.
//!
//! # It never reads what it carries
//!
//! The design's D1. A connection arrives, the service is made to run, the activator dials it and
//! copies bytes until one side closes — and nothing in that sentence mentions a protocol. FastCGI,
//! the MySQL protocol and RESP have nothing in common except that a client connects and something
//! is said, so an activator that parsed any of them would be a parser in `mixengined` written to
//! throw its own answer away.
//!
//! The consequence worth stating: a client that speaks first and one that waits to be greeted are
//! the same case here. The waiting client is the one a web-only design would never have met, and it
//! is most of what T70a will need.
//!
//! # Three answers, and each of them is bounded
//!
//! | The service is | This does |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | stopped, and nobody meant it to stay down | start it, wait, proxy |
//! | stopped, and a person stopped it | close the connection |
//! | running | proxy straight through |
//!
//! The middle row is the design's D8 and it is not a detail: `mix service stop mariadb@main`
//! followed by the next connection undoing it is the tool overruling its user. What makes it
//! answerable after a restart is `services.stopped_by`, written on every arrival at `stopped`.
//!
//! **The top row is wider than it was** — roadmap task **T123**. T70 wrote that column as a
//! boolean, so it said *the daemon idled this* and nothing else; a row that had never run and one a
//! restart left behind both fell to the middle row, and every PHP site on a machine that had been
//! rebooted answered 502 until somebody started its pool by hand. Three of the four ways a service
//! arrives at `stopped` are not a decision anybody made, and only the fourth may forbid a wake.
//!
//! The third row is not a special case for its own sake — a service that is running and whose
//! primary address was refused anyway is a fault this is not the place to diagnose, and proxying is
//! both the honest answer and the harmless one.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! **It does not decide how long a start may take.** That budget is the service's own `ReadyCheck`
//! timeout, which is already per-recipe and already the number a person raises when their machine
//! is slow. A second timeout invented here would give one slow MariaDB two different opinions.
//!
//! **It does not start a process.** It calls the same `Services::start` a person's `mix service
//! start` calls, with the plan built from the graph — so a dependency is started in order, and a
//! service already mid-start for another reason is joined rather than started twice. Activation is
//! a second *caller*, never a second way.
