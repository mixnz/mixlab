//! One task per service: spawn it, wait for it to be ready, watch it, restart it, stop it.
//!
//! **This is the loop `mixengine-supervisor` deliberately does not contain.** That crate delivers
//! the mechanisms — capture, ready, health, restart — as pieces with no loop, no clock and no state
//! row, because the thing that owns the timing is also the thing that owns the registry of running
//! services, the [`CancellationToken`] they hang off and the
//! [`transition`](mixengine_core::services::transition) that persists each move. That is the daemon,
//! and this module is where the four are tied together.
//!
//! Every state change goes through `mixengine_core::services::transition` and is published from the
//! value it hands back, so the row and the event cannot describe different events — the registry
//! never writes `services.state` behind `core`'s back.
