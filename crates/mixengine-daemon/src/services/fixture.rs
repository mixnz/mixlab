//! The scaffolding two test modules need: a home with rows in it, and a source of specs.
//!
//! **It lives in this crate rather than in `mixengine-testkit` because [`SpecSource`] is this
//! crate's own trait** — nothing outside the daemon can implement one. What it shares with the
//! testkit is `FakeService`, which is what every spec here is built around.
//!
//! Two callers, which is why it is a module and not a helper in one of them: the registry's own
//! tests walk plans directly, and the `service.*` handlers (T19a) go through the same registry from
//! above. A second copy of "a home with a `services` row" would be a second thing to keep in step
//! with `0001_initial.sql`.
