//! The registry of running services: what the daemon is supervising, and how a plan is walked.
//!
//! **This is where the timing lives.** `mixengine-supervisor` has the mechanisms and no loop;
//! `mixengine-core` has the graph, the state machine and the row; the daemon is what holds a task
//! per service, the [`CancellationToken`] it stops on, and the clock both of those are measured by.
//! Roadmap task **T19**.
//!
//! It is also where a daemon's first act lives: [`Registry::recover`] reconciles the rows the last
//! daemon left behind — adopting the processes that survived it, stopping the ones nothing can
//! supervise, and clearing the rows whose process is gone. Roadmap task **T18**, and the reason this
//! module reads a `services` row it did not write.
//!
//! A walk is **sequential over [`Plan::flat`]**, which is what T17 left this free to be: the tiers
//! are already computed, so M3's ten-second budget buys concurrency by changing this walker and
//! nothing else. A tier that fails stops the walk, and everything below it is marked
//! [`StateReason::DependencyFailed`] rather than spawned against a dependency that is not there.
