//! Readings in, minutes out — roadmap task **T71**.
//!
//! **The minute being assembled lives here and not in SQL.** Sixty readings against a
//! read-modify-write would be sixty transactions for one row, once a minute, for as long as somebody
//! watched; a daemon that dies loses at most the partial minute, which is the same thing a daemon
//! that dies loses about everything else.
//!
//! **A subject with no reading contributes no row.** A minute with no row means *nobody measured* —
//! the service was stopped, the machine was asleep, the daemon was being replaced — which is not the
//! same fact as *nothing was used*. Writing zeroes would turn one into the other, and a chart drawn
//! from them would show a service idling through a night it was not running at all.
