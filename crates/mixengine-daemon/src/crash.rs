//! What this daemon leaves behind when it hits a bug in itself. Roadmap task **T91**.
//!
//! **Three documents described this before it existed.** `docs/standards/rust.md` says the RPC
//! layer turns a panic into `internal`; `api/rpc.rs` says the message *"has already
//! gone to the log through the panic hook"*; `Cargo.toml`'s release profile keeps symbol names
//! because *"a daemon crash report is worthless without function names"*. There was no hook, and
//! `spawn_detached` gives the real daemon `Stdio::null()` for its stderr — so until this module the
//! message went nowhere at all.
//!
//! **The report carries no message and the log does.** Everything in a
//! [`CrashReport`] is a constant of this build, a literal from `std` or `tokio`, a symbol name, an
//! offset into the executable or its build identifier, which is what makes the file attachable to a
//! public bug report without being read first. The message is `format!`-ed from whatever was in
//! scope and can carry a path, so it goes to `daemon.log` — where paths a person chose already are,
//! and always have been.
//!
//! **A release build records offsets, not names** (T91a): its symbols ship beside the download, and
//! `scripts/symbolize.mjs` turns a report's offsets back into names with them.
//!
//! **Nothing here sends anything anywhere.** See
//! `docs/decisions/0022-a-crash-report-is-recorded-by-default-and-sent-by-nothing.md` and
//! `docs/decisions/0060-a-crash-report-carries-offsets-and-the-release-keeps-the-symbols.md`.
