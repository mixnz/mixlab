/// write-ahead log, which is what leaves one database file behind instead of one with a `-wal`
/// sidecar holding the newest commits. A budget that spent the whole ceiling on services would be
/// terminated in the middle of exactly that.
///
/// **Summed from its parts rather than chosen, because as one number it left no margin at all.** It
/// was two and a half seconds against a two-second client grace, so the checkpoint had five hundred
/// milliseconds and the whole came to the ceiling exactly: 2.5 s of services, 2 s of clients and
/// 0.5 s of checkpoint is 5 s of 5, with nothing left for a task scheduled late or a machine under
/// load — and `windows/signal.rs` says the ceiling itself may be *shorter* than five where
/// `WaitToKillTimeout` or `HungAppTimeout` were configured. So what it keeps back is now stated as
/// the three things that happen after the last service stops:
///
/// - [`SIGNAL_CLIENT_GRACE`], half a second for the connections still open,
/// - [`CHECKPOINT_MARGIN`], a second for `Store::close` and the write-ahead log,
/// - [`SCHEDULING_SLACK`], a second that is left over on purpose.
///
/// The total is the same 2.5 s, which leaves the services 2.5 s on Windows and puts the daemon at
/// 2.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4 s of the 5 s the OS allows, one second of it slack. **The margin is bought from
/// the clients rather than from the services**, which is the choice worth naming: shortening the
/// client grace on the signal path costs a client that is between requests nothing, where raising
/// this constant instead would have taken the same second out of MariaDB's flush.

///
/// **Bounded at all, because the whole point of the escalation is that a third signal must not be
/// needed.** A narrowed budget reaches a runner that has not begun its stop, and does not reach one

/// began, so a service that was inside one when the second request arrived runs to the end of the

/// *question* — whether the survivor this daemon just killed has left the process table. Asked with
/// no window at all it is asked microseconds after the kill, the kernel has not finished with the
/// process yet, and the answer is read as a survivor that will not go: the row keeps its `stopping`,
/// the stop is reported as failed, and the walk stops there on the ordering rule, so every service

/// **One window for the whole walk rather than an allowance per service**, which is what keeps it
