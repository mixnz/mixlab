//! `project.*`: the directories this home has been told about, and the versions they pin.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T39**. [`crate::packages`]' shape one namespace across, minus everything a
//! download needs: a project is rows and one file in somebody else's repository, so there is no
//! index, no fetcher and no job here.
//!
//! # The checks come first, in order of how specific they are
//!
//! `api/create.rs`' order and its reasoning: a root that is not an absolute directory is the
//! caller's own bug, a name that cannot be a handle is the user's typo, a manifest that does not
//! parse is the user's file — and only once all three have passed is a row written. The two unique
//! columns are still decided by the write, because whether a directory is free is a question about
//! the table.
//!
//! # A create does not write into the user's repository
//!
//! Spec D1. `project.export` is the one method that touches `mixengine.toml`, and it exists because
//! the point of that file is that a colleague gets it. A daemon that wrote to a checked-out working
//! tree on every update would be a daemon producing diffs nobody asked for, in a directory it does
//! not own.
