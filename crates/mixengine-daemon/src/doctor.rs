//! `mix doctor`, which reports and does not repair — roadmap task **T47a**.
//!
//! **Nothing here writes.** No row, no file, nothing enqueued, and no elevation prompt can result
//! from a call — which is what makes it safe to run on a timer, inside `mix status`, and inside
//! T93's bundle. Repairing what it finds is `daemon.doctor_repair`, and that is T47b's.
//!
//! Every check is assembled from the reader its subsystem already owns — the hosts block from T41's
//! comparison, the resolver from T45's probe, the domains from T46's report — rather than from a
//! second opinion. Two implementations of one question are two answers to it.
//!
//! # Three outcomes that are not failures
//!
//! [`Outcome::Ok`] is the ordinary one. [`Outcome::Note`] is a fact worth stating that nobody can
//! act on — `hosts_only` is a supported mode and macOS genuinely makes no promise about a killed
//! daemon's descendants — and reporting either as a fault would put a permanent problem on a
//! correctly working machine. [`Outcome::Skipped`] is a check that could not run and says why, which
//! is the difference between "there is nothing wrong here" and "nobody looked".
