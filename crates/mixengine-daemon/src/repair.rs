//! `daemon.doctor_repair`, which acts on what `mix doctor` found — roadmap task **T47b**.
//!
//! **One call, at most one prompt.** Repairs that live inside `MIXENGINE_HOME` are made here and
//! now; repairs that need root are *enqueued* through the same producers everything else uses. [ADR
//! 0005](../../../docs/decisions/0005-on-demand-elevation.md) settled that asking twice for one
//! batch is the defect, and this module is the shape that obeys it.
//!
//! **Whether the queue is then flushed in the same call is the caller's to say**, and T64 is why.
//! What is about to be allowed has to be readable *before* it is allowed, and a call that enqueued
//! and flushed in one step leaves no moment for a client to show it. So the ordinary path is two
//! calls — this one, then `elevation.grant` — and [`DoctorRepair::grant`] is for a caller that has
//! already shown the batch and been answered.
//!
//! **Which repair a condition gets is decided by [`plan_for`], and that match is exhaustive.** It is
//! the whole of what T47a bought by closing [`ProblemId`]: an id added later stops this file
//! compiling until somebody decides what repairing it means. A `_ =>` arm would turn that compile
//! error into a silent no-op and let the two halves drift apart — which is the defect the closed
//! enum exists to prevent.
//!
//! Deciding is separated from doing so the table can be read, and tested, without a machine.
