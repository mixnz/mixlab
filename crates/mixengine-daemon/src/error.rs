//! Where a library error becomes the one a client sees.
//!
//! Every crate below keeps its own `thiserror` enum, shaped for the code that raises it and knowing
//! nothing about codes, hints or the wire. The translation happens here, once, at the boundary —
//! `docs/standards/rust.md`. Three things happen in it, and none of them belong anywhere else:
//!
//! - **The chain is flattened.** A client is handed one string and has no `source()` to walk, so
//!   every cause is folded into the message before it leaves. That part is
//!   [`mixengine_proto::flatten`], because `mix` maps the handful of failures it can meet without a
//!   daemon and has to produce the same shape of message.
//! - **A code is chosen.** That is the part a program branches on, so the choice is made by
//!   somebody who can see both sides — the library variant and the published vocabulary.
//! - **A hint is written**, where the daemon knows something the library did not. The library knows
//!   that `create` returned `EACCES`; only this layer knows that MixEngine never runs as an
//!   administrator and that `[paths]` exists. Where the library message already names the way out,
//!   the hint stays `None` rather than saying it a second time in the GUI.
