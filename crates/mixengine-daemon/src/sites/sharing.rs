//! Putting one site on the local network, and taking it back off — roadmap task **T74**.
//!
//! Five things move, and the order they move in is the whole of this module.
//!
//! **Sharing**: write the row, re-render and reload the front end, reissue the certificate, then ask
//! for the firewall rule. The rule is last because a rule open on a port nothing is listening on is
//! the one state a user cannot diagnose — the phone says "connection refused" either way, and the
//! machine has been changed in a way nobody can see.
//!
//! **Unsharing**: ask for the rule to go first, then the row, the rendering and the certificate.
//! Reversed for the same reason from the other side: the window where the machine is more open than
//! the configuration says is the window that must not exist.
//!
//! One `PrivilegedOp` either way, and only one — the feature spec's *"one elevation prompt, the only
//! one in normal day-to-day use"*. It is whole-state
//! ([`mixengine_proto::privileged::FirewallPlan`]), so it carries every shared site's
//! ports rather than this one's, and an unshare of the last shared site carries none at all.
