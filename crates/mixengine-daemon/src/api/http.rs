//! The HTTP/1.1 half: routing, limits, and the connection each client gets.
//!
//! HTTP is what `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md` chose over a bespoke frame format, and the
//! reason is visible here — streaming, back-pressure and body limits are all `hyper`'s, and the CLI,
//! the GUI and any future extension get a client library for free instead of a hand-written framer
//! each.
//!
//! **The HTTP status is about the envelope, never about the call.** A JSON-RPC method that fails
//! comes back `200` with an `error` member, because the request *was* delivered, parsed and
//! answered. Mixing the two would make a client branch in two places on one outcome, and would make
//! `not_found` on a site indistinguishable from `/rpc` having been typed as `/rcp`. The statuses
//! this module does use — `204`, `400`, `404`, `405`, `413` — are all about the envelope.
