//! The API server: JSON-RPC over HTTP/1.1 on the local endpoint T7 opened.
//!
//! Three layers, one per file, and the split is the same one the architecture draws:
//!
//! - [`http`] is the transport. Routing, body limits, timeouts, spans, and the connection loop.
//! - [`rpc`] is the protocol. Batches, notifications, method dispatch, panic containment.
//! - [`events`] is the stream. `GET /events`, a bounded broadcast, and what a slow client is told.
//! - [`logs`] is the other stream. `GET /logs/service/{id}` and `GET /logs/job/{id}`, which carry
//!   one subject's output and are
//!   separate from [`events`] on purpose — see
//!   `docs/decisions/0009-logs-travel-on-their-own-stream.md`.
//!
//! Nothing in here is business logic — `CLAUDE.md` puts that in `mixengine-core` — and the
//! handlers are the proof: each one turns state the daemon already holds into a `mixengine-proto`
//! type and does nothing else.

// Reachable by name rather than only through the re-export below, because a `Frame` is what a
// subscriber receives and the registry's tests assert on the ones its transitions produce.
// Crate-visible for one name: `blueprints::planned` reads the scaffold's PATH from
// `api::apply::scaffold`, so that a plan judges a command against the string the shell would be
// started with (T78b, D3).
