//! `service.create` and `service.delete`: the two ends of a `services` row's life.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T31a**. Their own file rather than more of [`super::rpc`], which is already the
//! longest in this crate, and together rather than beside their namespake neighbours because they
//! are one decision read forwards and backwards: what a create writes is exactly what a delete
//! takes away, and the second is the first's rollback when a rendering fails.
//!
//! # A create renders before it answers
//!
//! [`declared`](crate::services::declared) fails the **whole** declared set when one row cannot be
//! rendered — a graph is a property of a set, so there is no such thing as walking the good rows and
//! skipping the bad one. A row inserted and left behind would therefore take `service.list`,
//! `service.start` and every other `service.*` call down with it, for a service the caller was told
//! had failed. So the render happens inside the call, and a failure deletes the row it just wrote.
//!
//! # A delete keeps the data directory, and names it
//!
//! Generated configuration is disposable: `etc/<service-id>/` is rendered from the row and can be
//! rendered again, so it goes. A data directory is somebody's databases, there is no undo behind a
//! local development tool, and nothing about deleting a service says anything about wanting the data
//! gone. It is *named* in the answer rather than silently left, because a directory nobody was told
//! about is a directory nobody ever cleans up.
