//! `GET /events` — the daemon telling clients what changed, as Server-Sent Events.
//!
//! **Best-effort, and the architecture says so in as many words:** a client that reconnects, or one
//! that is handed a [`DaemonEvent::Resync`], calls the matching `*.list` and rebuilds what it knows.
//! Nothing here is a queue and nothing here is durable — an event missed while the GUI was closed is
//! missed for good, which is fine precisely because it is never the only way state is learned.
//!
//! **A slow consumer is dropped, not buffered.** The channel is bounded, and a receiver that falls
//! behind it loses the messages it did not read. That is a design decision and not a limitation: the
//! alternative is a client that stops reading and takes the daemon's memory with it. What such a
//! receiver gets instead is a `Resync` naming how many it missed, which is more useful than the
//! events themselves would have been — by then its picture is stale in ways no replay would fix.
