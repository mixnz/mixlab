//! What an apply made, and what a failure does about it — roadmap task **T78**, the design's D4.
//!
//! # Intent, not success
//!
//! [`super::super::create`] keeps the `services` row it wrote when the rendering fails, and
//! `sites::create` does the same for a site, deliberately: *a declaration rolled back because the
//! rendering failed would leave a person with nothing to fix.* So an entry goes in **before** the
//! call that would make it, and every undo is "remove it if it is there". A ledger written only
//! after `Ok` would miss precisely the failures a rollback exists for.
//!
//! # What is undone belongs to the project; what is kept belongs to the machine
//!
//! A database is **never** dropped: by the time an apply has failed something may have migrated into
//! it, and there is no `database.drop` in this product. A runtime or package this apply installed
//! stays, because it belongs to the machine and is what a resumed apply would otherwise download
//! again. A PHP extension stays, for the reason the plan renderer already says on that line: the
//! choice reaches every project here. The project's directory stays and is named, on
//! `project.delete`'s standing rule — the files were never ours.
//!
//! Each of those is *named* in the failure rather than silently left, because a thing nobody was
//! told about is a thing nobody ever cleans up.
