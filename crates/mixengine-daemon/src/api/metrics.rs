//! `GET /metrics` — what everything is costing, a frame per tick, while somebody is watching.
//!
//! **Opening this connection is the subscription and closing it is the end of it.** There is no
//! `metrics.subscribe` method, for [ADR
//! 0009](https://github.com/mixnz/mixlab/blob/master/docs/decisions/0009-logs-travel-on-their-own-stream.md)'s
//! reason and for one more of its own: a subscription ended by a second call would leave a client
//! that crashed sampling this machine every second for as long as the daemon ran. A socket closing
//! cannot be forgotten.
//!
//! **The rate is a consequence of this route, not a setting.** The watch the stream holds is what
//! puts the sampler on its one-second period; it lives in the stream's own state, so it is dropped
//! exactly when the body ends — whether the client closed the window, lost the socket, or the daemon
//! is shutting down.
//!
//! **A reader that falls behind is given the newest frame rather than a resync.** Eight frames of
//! back-pressure, where the event bus holds 1024: for a metric the old value is worth nothing and
//! the next one is a second away, so there is nothing to replay and nothing to ask the client to
//! re-fetch.
