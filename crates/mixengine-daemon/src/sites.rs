//! `site.*`: what is served out of a project's directory, and at what name.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T39a**. [`crate::projects`]' shape one table down, and nothing more: this task
//! declares, and T43 serves. No config file is rendered here and no process is started — but a
//! declared name has to resolve, so every write asks [`crate::elevation`] for the hosts file this
//! home now needs (T41). Asking is all it does: the operation waits for somebody to allow it.
//!
//! # A create is also the import
//!
//! [`ProjectCreate`](mixengine_proto::ProjectCreate)'s rule, one table down (spec D7): every field
//! but the project falls through — the argument, then `[site]` in the project's manifest, then a
//! default. `site.create { project }` with nothing else typed is therefore how a colleague's
//! checkout gets its site, and there is one code path rather than two for one outcome.
//!
//! # Two answers about a pool, because the row holds one of them
//!
//! A php-fpm site's pool is frozen at create while the project's shell keeps following the default.
//! [`mixengine_proto::SitePool`] reports `declared` — what the row holds — beside
//! `resolved` — what `core::resolve` answers at that root today — so somebody whose site is on
//! 8.3.34 while their shell is on 8.3.35 can see that rather than guess at it.
//!
//! # The order of the checks
//!
//! `api/create.rs`' order and its reasoning: cheapest and most specific first, and nothing is
//! written until every one of them has passed. The project, then the doc root, then the domains,
//! then the kind's payload, then the services, then the pool — and only then the write, whose
//! unique index has the last word about whether a domain was free.
