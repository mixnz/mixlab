//! **Not [`crate::php_extensions`]**, which turns a *PHP* extension on for one installed runtime.

//!
//! A façade and nothing more — every decision here is `mixengine_core::extensions`', because
//! `CLAUDE.md` puts no business logic in a client and the daemon is the client's server rather than
//! a second place for rules. What belongs *here* is what only the daemon has: the home's paths, its
//! store, the registry client and the job runner.
//!
//! **Consent is checked here rather than trusted.** A client sends the plan it showed somebody
//! ([`ExtensionConsent`]), and this compares it against the manifest it is about to install — the
//! shape `[scaffold]` consent already has, and for its reason: the registry can be refreshed between
//! the reading and the sending, and a consent naming what was shown is the only kind that cannot be
//! spent on something else.
