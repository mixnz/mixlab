//! `domain.*` — roadmap task **T46**.
//!
//! Two verbs and a diagnostic. The verbs are **thin over [`Sites`] on purpose**: each computes a new
//! domain list and hands it to the same update the `site.*` half uses, so the TLD check, the hosts
//! queueing and the front-end re-render have exactly one implementation between them (T46 design,
//! D1). What is here that is not there is the *reason* a caller cannot compose them itself — a read,
//! an append and a write back is a race with whatever another client did in between.
