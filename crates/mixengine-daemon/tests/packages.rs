//!
//! **What is published is `fakeservice`**, because a debug build has a recipe for it and the archive
//! can be a real executable that needs no server behind it. The index also publishes a
//! [`UNRUNNABLE`], which this build has no recipe for — that is what makes the catalogue filter mean
//! something, since a fixture offering only what is runnable could not tell a filter that works from
//! one that does nothing.
