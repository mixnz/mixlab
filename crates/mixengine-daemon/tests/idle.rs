//! A service nothing is using is stopped, by a real daemon on its own clock — task **T69**.
//!
//! The arithmetic is settled against a mock beside `services::idle`, the reading against a fake
//! server in `mixengine-supervisor`, and the surface against a real socket in the CLI's own suite.
//! What is left is the wiring, and it is the half most easily wrong in a way nothing else notices:
//! that the sweeper runs at all without anybody asking, and that the stop it performs says **why**.
//!
//! **The reason is the assertion this suite exists for.** A sweeper wired to the registry but not to
//! `Registry::stopping_because` — or one that sets the reason *after* it cancels rather than before
//! — stops exactly the right service at exactly the right moment and tells the person who asks that
//! somebody requested it. Every other test in this task would still pass.
//!
//! # Why this suite takes a minute
//!
//! `services.idle_minutes` stores minutes, so the shortest policy anybody can express is one; and a
//! policy is spent in whole sweeps, so the fastest a service can reach its end is one sweep of sixty
//! seconds. That is the floor, and it is the price of the column's unit rather than something the
//! test could be written around. One test pays it, once.
