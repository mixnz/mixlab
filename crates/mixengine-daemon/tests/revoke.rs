//! A share ending on its own, against a real `mixengined` — roadmap task **T76**.
//!
//! What the unit tests beside `sites::revoke` prove is that a reading becomes the right decision.
//! What is proved here is the part only a daemon can be wrong about: that the loop runs on its own
//! timer at all, that it takes `site.unshare`'s road rather than a second copy of it, and that the
//! row it leaves behind is empty.
//!
//! **`check_seconds = 1`**, so a deadline of one second is over in a few periods rather than in
//! half a minute. That the key exists at all is why this suite can exist — the T76 design, D1.
//!
//! The `Daemon` and `Client` here are `tests/renewal.rs`' — which are `tests/sites.rs`' before that
//! — because a third spelling of a JSON-RPC client is a third thing to keep in step.
