//! The API, against a real `mixengined` on a real endpoint.
//!
//! Not a component test with the router called directly: `mixengine-daemon` is a binary crate with
//! no library target, so an integration test cannot reach inside it — and reaching inside is what
//! would be worth avoiding anyway. What is proved here is the part the unit tests next to the code
//! cannot reach: that a daemon started the way a user starts one binds the endpoint its home
//! implies, speaks HTTP over a socket that is not a network socket, and answers each route the way
//! `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md` says it does.
//!
//! Every test gets its own `MIXENGINE_HOME` in a `TempDir` **passed as `--home`** — rule 2 in
//! `docs/standards/testing.md`: the environment is process-global, and two of these running at
//! once under `cargo test` would rewrite each other's home. Nothing here touches the network; a
//! Unix socket and a named pipe are neither.
